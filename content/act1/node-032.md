## Node 032: Common Ground

*The Threshold Stage — Backstage Corner*

The Pawn's question hangs between you. *What do you actually want with me?*

It's not aggressive. It's not suspicious anymore—not entirely. They're genuinely asking. After a lifetime of being told what they wanted, what they needed, what their *destiny* required, someone is finally waiting for their answer.

Which means your response matters more than you might think.

**[STAT CHECK: Stage Presence 1]**

You need to maintain the right posture. Not threatening. Not submissive. Present.

**Success:** You meet their gaze steadily, but you keep your hands visible, your body language open. You're not here to take anything from them.

"Right now? I want to understand what's happening. The boundary is breaking. Characters are escaping. Maren says I'm supposed to help fix it, but—" You pause, choosing honesty. "I don't know if 'fixing it' means pushing people like you back into stories they hate."

The Pawn's expression shifts. Interest, maybe. Or recognition.

"You don't know," they repeat. "You're not pretending ignorance to manipulate me. You genuinely don't know what you're supposed to do."

"I've been a Prompter for about two hours."

Something almost like a smile crosses their face. "The author would hate you. No backstory. No hidden destiny. Just... someone new, trying to figure things out."

They relax slightly—not completely, but enough to signal that the hostility has ebbed.

"Very well. Let's figure things out together. At least until I decide whether you're another handler or something else."

**Failure:** Your body language betrays you. Maybe you lean forward too eagerly. Maybe you cross your arms defensively. Whatever the tell, the Pawn notices.

"You're nervous," they observe. Not accusatory—just noting a fact. "You want something from this conversation."

"Everyone wants something from every conversation," you manage.

"True." They don't relax, but they don't shut down either. "The difference is whether you're honest about it. Aldric smiled at me for fifteen years before I found his notes. His warmth was genuine—he did care about me. But he cared about his mission more."

The tension rises slightly, but the Pawn continues.

"So. What's your mission, would-be Prompter? And how much do you care about it compared to the people it affects?"

You don't have a good answer. Not yet. But they're still talking, still engaging. That has to count for something.

**Choices:**

*This node resolves directly to Node 033 based on check outcome.*

---

**Notes:**
- Stage Presence 1 check per ACT1_MECHANICS.md (Basic difficulty)
- Tests player's ability to maintain non-threatening posture
- Success builds initial trust; failure increases suspicion but maintains dialogue
- References Aldric (the planted mentor) to reinforce Pawn's trauma around authority figures
- Fail-forward: Both outcomes proceed to Node 033, but relationship quality differs
