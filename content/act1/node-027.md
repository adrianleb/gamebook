## Node 027: The Revenant's Trail

*The Threshold Theatre — Horror Wing Storage*

The horror wing hasn't been used in years. The Threshold Theatre tried a season of gothic productions once—Dracula, The Turn of the Screw, a deeply ill-advised Frankenstein—and the audience never quite recovered. Now the wing serves as storage for sets too elaborate to discard and too unsettling to repurpose.

You enter through a service door and immediately understand why they stopped producing horror here. The air is wrong. Cold in a way that has nothing to do with ventilation. The kind of cold that belongs in basements, in crypts, in manor houses where terrible things happened long ago.

The Genre Compass—if it's working—points straight ahead.

The storage area is a maze of canvas flats and wooden frameworks. A painted fireplace looms out of the darkness. A doorframe leads to nothing. And somewhere deeper in, something is whispering.

Not words, exactly. More like the memory of words. The same phrase, repeated endlessly: *Page 113. Page 113. Page 113.*

You've found the Revenant.

They manifest slowly, coalescing from shadow and suggestion. A figure in period dress—Victorian, perhaps, or earlier. Their face flickers between states: peaceful, then anguished, then peaceful again. The cycle repeats every few seconds, like a gif stuck in an eternal loop.

**"You hunt me,"** they say. Their voice echoes, overlapping with itself. **"They all hunt me. I am hunted, was hunted, will be hunted..."**

They drift closer. The temperature drops further. Your breath fogs in the air.

**"But you are different."** The Revenant tilts their head, studying you with eyes that don't quite focus. **"You read about me first. You researched. You... prepared."**

Their form stabilizes slightly. Less flickering. More coherent.

**"I remember warmth. I was warm once. Before page 113. Before the knife. Before the eternal, endless, *exhausting* repetition of my death."**

They extend a hand toward you. Not threatening—pleading.

**"Can you make it stop? Not the death. The repetition. I want to stop. I want to be *done*."**
