## Node 037: Maren's Perspective

*The Threshold Stage — Returning to the Booth*

You and the Pawn move back toward the Prompter's Booth. The boundary still ripples behind you—the Runaway's escape hasn't healed, and more characters could breach at any moment—but for now, you've found something unexpected: a potential ally.

Maren is waiting where you left her. Her expression is carefully neutral, but you've already learned to read the subtle tells. The slight tension around her eyes. The way she holds the Prompter's Handbook just a bit too tightly.

"Interesting approach," she says. "Most new Prompters would have tried to chase them both. Or at least call for backup."

"I'm not most new Prompters."

"No." Something almost like approval flickers in her gaze. "You're not."

The Pawn hangs back, watching the exchange. To them, Maren is another authority figure—another potential Aldric. But they're not fleeing. Not yet.

Maren notices. She turns to address the Pawn directly.

"I know what you are. What you escaped from." Her voice carries the weight of decades. "I've been doing this for forty years. I've seen characters run before. Some want freedom. Some want revenge. Some just want to stop existing."

"And me?" the Pawn asks warily.

"You want to understand. That's rarer." Maren pauses. "And more dangerous."

She moves toward them, not threatening but deliberate.

"Characters who understand their own construction—who see the narrative machinery—they become something else. Not just escapees. They become *editors*. Whether they mean to or not."

The word lands heavily. *Editors.* You've seen the term in the Handbook, always capitalized. Something to be wary of.

"I'm not—" the Pawn starts.

"Not yet." Maren's voice softens slightly. "Maybe never. But the potential is there. Which means the people who manage the Understage will want to know about you. And not all of them will be as understanding as your new friend here."

She turns back to you.

"You've made an interesting choice. Talking instead of chasing. Building connection instead of asserting control. It's not the traditional approach."

"Is that a problem?"

"That depends on what happens next." Maren glances toward the boundary. "The Runaway is still loose. The breach is still open. And the Understage is waiting. Whether you've gained an ally or a liability—that's for the crossing to decide."

She hands you something: a small token, marked with the Prompter's seal.

"Keep this close. It identifies you as under my authority. When you cross over, show it to whoever you meet first. It might buy you time before they decide what to do with you."

The Pawn watches this exchange with the calculating gaze of someone who's learned to assess power dynamics quickly.

"You're sending them into the Understage?" they ask Maren. "After one evening of training?"

"The Understage doesn't care about training schedules," Maren replies. "It cares about choices. Your friend here has made some interesting ones. Now we find out if they were the right ones."
