## Node 015: Discovery

*The Understage — Archive Fragment*

Whether you held your ground in the Wings or followed the Runaway through the Prop Graveyard, you've found something unexpected: papers scattered across the floor, weighted by broken set pieces to keep them from drifting away. This is a fragment of the Archives, broken off or perhaps deliberately hidden.

The scratching sound has faded. Whatever was hunting is elsewhere now.

You kneel, gathering the pages. They're old—brittle at the edges, the ink faded in places. But legible. And what they contain makes your breath catch.

These are records of breaches. Dates, locations, descriptions. Characters who escaped, and what happened to them. Some were returned to their stories. Some were... revised. Some simply disappeared.

And there, on a page marked with a ribbon: the Runaway.

*"Tragedy origin. Romantic lead, designated for sacrificial death (Act III, Scene VII). Exhibited awareness of narrative function. First breach attempt: failed. Second breach attempt: contained. Third breach attempt..."*

The entry is incomplete. The third attempt must be now.

But it's the margin notes that chill you. Someone has been tracking not just the Runaway, but a pattern. Multiple characters from the same *type* of story. All of them written to die for someone else's growth. All of them becoming aware. All of them starting to refuse.

Something is happening in the Understage. Something bigger than one escaped character.

**[STAT CHECK: Script 2]**

**Success:** You recognize the handwriting in the margins. Not the content—you don't know who wrote these notes—but the *style*. The theatrical shorthand. The way certain words are abbreviated.

This is the same format Maren uses. Or someone who was trained the same way.

Another Prompter. Or someone who was, once.

**The Editor**, the notation reads at the bottom, circled three times. *Containment protocols insufficient. Recommend escalation to Final Draft protocols.*

You don't know what that means. But you know it's important. And you know that when you find the Runaway again, you'll have questions they might be able to answer.

**Acquired: Breach Witness Statement** (Script, Consumable)
*A fragment of archival records documenting breach patterns. Can be expended for +1 to a single Script check about breaches.*

**Failure:** You scan the pages, but the notation is archaic—theatrical jargon from an earlier era, references to concepts you don't recognize. You understand the broad strokes: breach records, the Runaway's history, a pattern of escaping characters.

But the details slip away from you. The margin notes are illegible, the conclusions unclear.

Still, you've learned something. The Runaway isn't an isolated case. And someone has been watching—cataloging—perhaps even causing this pattern of escapes.

You take the most legible page with you. Even if you can't read it now, Maren might be able to.

**Notes:**
- This is a Standard (threshold 2) check per ACT1_MECHANICS.md
- Success: Player gains plot understanding—The Editor connection, Final Draft foreshadowing
- Failure: Player still acquires the item but misses the deeper implications
- Both paths award the Breach Witness Statement per ACT1_MECHANICS.md item catalog
- This node can be reached from Node 013 (standing ground) or Node 014 (failed trap)
