## Node 022: Archaic Notation

*The Prompter's Booth — Deep Archives*

The Stagehand appears before you finish calling for them. They have a way of doing that—manifesting at the edges of need, as if they can feel when they're required. Their hands are full of yellowed papers, bound with ribbon that might once have been red.

"The old records," they say, setting the bundle on the table. "The Stagehand found them. The Stagehand always knows where things are. Even the things that don't want to be found."

They pause, tilting their head at an angle that makes them look momentarily inhuman. "These are from before. Before the current notation. Before... before many things."

The documents are written in a script that resembles theatrical notation but isn't. Stage directions blend with astrological symbols. Character names are rendered as geometric shapes. Emotion is marked in what appears to be musical notation—except the intervals don't correspond to any scale you know.

This is how Prompters documented their work before standardization. Before the twentieth century made everything clinical and categorized.

**[STAT CHECK: Script 1]**

You study the archaic notation, trying to decipher its underlying logic.

**Success:** There's a pattern. The geometric shapes correspond to archetypes, not individual characters. The musical notation marks emotional intensity, not pitch. Once you see it, the system becomes almost elegant—more intuitive than modern documentation, if harder to parse.

You begin to understand what you're reading: a record of breaches dating back centuries. Patterns emerge. Certain stories produce more escapees than others. Tragedies. Horror. Stories where characters die badly and often.

**Failure:** The notation defeats you. You can identify individual symbols but not their relationships. It's like trying to read a sentence when you only know the alphabet.

"Maren taught the Stagehand," they offer quietly. "Long ago. The Stagehand could... translate. If you wanted."

They pick up a document at random and begin to read, their voice taking on a strange rhythm. "The one who burned. From the story of the manor. They escaped during the third reading. They were cold. So cold. They asked about warmth. They were..." The Stagehand falters. "The Stagehand doesn't remember the rest. The Stagehand doesn't remember many things."

But you've learned enough. The pattern is there, even if the Stagehand must help you see it.

**Notes:**
- Script 1 (Basic) check per ACT1_MECHANICS.md
- Success: Player interprets documents independently
- Failure: Stagehand translates, revealing their connection to older breaches
- The Stagehand's translation hints at The Revenant's past (the one who burned/was cold)
