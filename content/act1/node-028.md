## Node 028: The Stagehand's Secret

*The Threshold Theatre — Horror Wing Storage*

The Revenant fades before you can respond fully. Not gone—you can still feel that cold presence at the edge of perception—but retreated. Perhaps they've exhausted themselves. Perhaps they need time to process that someone finally listened.

As the temperature normalizes, you become aware of another presence. The Stagehand stands at the storage room entrance, silhouetted against the dim light of the corridor. They've been watching. For how long, you can't say.

"The cold one," they say softly. "The one who burns. The Stagehand... remembers them. From before."

They step into the storage area, moving with uncharacteristic hesitance. Their usual certainty—that sense of always knowing where things are and how things work—seems diminished here.

"The Stagehand was told not to remember. Long ago. Maren said it was safer. But the Stagehand remembers anyway. Sometimes. In pieces."

They pick up a prop from a nearby shelf—a painted knife, obviously fake, yet their hand trembles as they hold it.

"Page 113. The Stagehand knows that page. Knows it like... like their own name. Except the Stagehand doesn't have a name anymore. Only a role."

This is it. The moment the records hinted at. The Stagehand knows something about the Revenant—about breaches—about their own origin. The question is whether you can draw it out.

**[APPROACH CHECK: Script 3 OR Stage Presence 2]**

**Script 3 Approach:** You reference what you learned in the archives—the old notation, the breach patterns, the connection between the Stagehand and the escapes they helped document. You approach with knowledge.

**Stage Presence 2 Approach:** You speak to them directly, with presence and gentle authority. You approach with understanding.

---

**Script 3 Success:** You piece together the fragments from your research. "You were there. Thirty-seven years ago. When the previous Prompter went into the Understage and didn't come back. Maren brought back knowledge—but she also brought back you."

The Stagehand goes very still.

"The Stagehand... was once a character. In a story. The same story as the cold one—the Revenant. We died on the same page. Page 113. But the Stagehand was offered a choice. Forget, and serve. Or remember, and..."

They trail off. The painted knife clatters to the floor.

"The Stagehand chose to forget. But the Revenant remembers for both of us."

**Stage Presence 2 Success:** You take their hand, steadying them. "It's okay. You don't have to remember everything. Just... what you can. What you're ready for."

They look at you with something like gratitude.

"The Stagehand was cold once. Like the Revenant. From the same place. The same page. But the Stagehand was given warmth again. Given purpose. In exchange for..."

They gesture vaguely at their own head.

"The Stagehand forgot on purpose. To survive. But the Revenant couldn't forget. That's why they want to stop. Because remembering forever is worse than dying once."

→ Proceed to The First Crossing (Node 040)

**Failure (Either Approach):** The Stagehand shakes their head, pulling back from the edge of revelation. Whatever memory was surfacing retreats again.

"The Stagehand shouldn't... this isn't the time. The breach. The Runaway. That's what matters now. The Stagehand will... the Stagehand will tell you later. Maybe. If they remember."

They collect themselves, slipping back into their helpful persona like donning a familiar mask.

But something has changed. They've acknowledged that there's something to remember. And you've noticed.
