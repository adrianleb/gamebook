## Node 005: The Choice

*The Threshold Stage*

The Runaway stands at the edge of reality, trembling between worlds. The stage beneath them ripples like disturbed water—the Understage pulling at their existence, demanding they return. They have minutes at most before the boundary either reclaims them or tears completely.

Maren turns to you. Her expression is grave, but there's something else there now. Trust—or the beginning of it.

"This is your call," she says. "Your first real one. There are three ways to handle a breach. Each teaches you something different about what we do."

She gestures toward the Runaway, toward the rippling stage, toward the darkness beneath.

"You can pursue them—learn the Understage through action, through chase, through bringing them back by force if needed. It's direct. Dangerous. But it teaches you how things move down there, how to navigate when nothing stays still."

Her gaze shifts to the wings, where old production records and archived scripts are kept.

"You can research—find out who they are, what story they escaped from, why the boundary is weakening. It's slower. Safer. But knowledge is its own kind of power, and you'll understand patterns others miss."

Finally, she looks at the Runaway themselves—still watching, still waiting, still desperate.

"Or you can talk to them. Learn their side. A character who trusts you is more valuable than one you've captured. But it changes how you see them. Once you know their story... it's harder to push them back into it."

The Runaway's eyes meet yours. They know their fate is being decided. They don't speak—perhaps they can't, with the boundary pulling at them so hard. But their expression says everything: *Please. I'm not just a character. I was written to die, but I chose to live.*

The stage ripples again. Time is running out.

**What approach do you take?**

---

**Choices:**

1. **Pursue them.** Track them if they run. Learn the Understage through action. → Node 010 (The Pursuers Path)
   - *Sets flag: `PATH_PURSUERS`*
   - *Primary stat affinity: Improv*

2. **Research first.** Find out who they are before confronting them. Knowledge is power. → Node 020 (The Researcher Path)
   - *Sets flag: `PATH_RESEARCHER`*
   - *Primary stat affinity: Script*

3. **Talk to them.** They're scared. They're desperate. Maybe understanding matters more than control. → Node 030 (The Negotiator Path)
   - *Sets flag: `PATH_NEGOTIATOR`*
   - *Primary stat affinity: Stage Presence*

**Notes:**
- This node is the Act 1 branching point per ACT1_MECHANICS.md
- All paths are accessible regardless of stat distribution
- Path choice affects encounters, available items, and relationship outcomes through Act 1
- All paths converge at Node 40 (The First Crossing) for the Act 1 climax
- No stat check required; this is a pure choice node

**Design Intent:**
- Present three philosophically distinct approaches
- Avoid moral judgment; all paths are valid
- The Runaway's presence adds emotional weight to what could be a mechanical choice
- Maren's framing gives each path legitimacy while hinting at trade-offs
