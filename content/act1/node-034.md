## Node 034: Story Knowledge

*The Threshold Stage — Backstage Corner*

Your response hangs in the air between you—sympathy, pragmatism, or honesty, whichever you chose. The Pawn considers it, weighing your words against a lifetime of manipulation.

Then something shifts in their expression. Not trust exactly, but... interest.

"You know," they say slowly, "I've been waiting for someone to slip. To say the wrong thing. Use the wrong phrase. Reveal that they've been briefed, that they *know my story* and are working from a script."

They lean forward.

"But you don't know my story, do you? You've never heard of the Greymarch Prophecy or the Kingdoms of Ashvale or the Dark Lord Maeven. To you, I'm just... someone who escaped."

It's true. The Prompter's Handbook has categories and frameworks, but specific stories—individual characters—you're learning those as you encounter them.

The Pawn seems to find this both relieving and unsettling.

"Then let me tell you what you're dealing with. The story you'd be sending me back to."

**[STAT CHECK: Script 2]**

As the Pawn describes their world—the ancient prophecy, the destined hero, the carefully orchestrated tragedy—you search your training for context. The Handbook mentioned different narrative structures. Can you recognize the patterns in what they're describing?

**Success:** You catch it. The structure beneath the story.

"The Chosen One framework," you say. "That's one of the oldest narrative templates. Hero born in obscurity, hidden lineage revealed, mentor guides them to destiny, sacrifice at the climax."

The Pawn stares at you.

"You recognize it because it's a *template*. Your whole story follows a blueprint. The prophecy isn't mystical—it's structural. Someone designed you to fit a form."

"Yes." Their voice is quiet. "Exactly that. But understanding the form..." They trail off, something new in their expression. "You see what I was written as. The shape I was poured into. That's more than Aldric ever showed me. He wanted me to believe in the destiny, not see through it."

A thread of connection forms. You understand their story not as a participant but as an analyst. It's not empathy exactly, but it's recognition.

**Failure:** You listen, but the framework eludes you. High fantasy epics, ancient prophecies—it's a lot to take in, and the patterns blur together.

"I'm sorry," you admit when they finish. "I'm still learning to recognize story structures. I can see you were trapped in something—I just can't name what."

The Pawn deflates slightly, but doesn't close off.

"It's... fine. Most people don't see the machinery. They just experience the story. I spent years inside mine before I noticed the gears."

They stand, pacing toward the boundary's distant shimmer.

"Perhaps it doesn't matter whether you understand the specifics. You're listening. That's more than I expected."

**Notes:**
- Script 2 check per ACT1_MECHANICS.md (Standard difficulty)
- Success demonstrates player's ability to analyze narrative structure
- The "Chosen One framework" concept connects to CHARACTERS.md (Pawn as "hero-shaped thing")
- Fail-forward: Success builds intellectual connection; failure builds emotional one
- Named story elements (Greymarch Prophecy, Kingdoms of Ashvale, Dark Lord Maeven) flesh out Pawn's origin
