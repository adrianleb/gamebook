## Node 001: The Prompter's Booth

*The Prompter's Booth — Threshold Theatre*

The booth smells of dust, old paper, and something like ozone. You've worked here for three years now, tucked into this cramped space behind the stage's left wing, and still you can't name that third smell. It's strongest at night, when the theater is empty and the scripts seem to whisper to each other.

Tonight, the whispers are louder than usual.

Your station is modest: a battered desk, a gooseneck lamp that flickers when it shouldn't, and the Prompter's Handbook—a leather-bound volume that was already ancient when Maren pressed it into your hands. The Handbook sits open to a page you don't remember turning. The words there are... wrong. Letters sliding into formations they shouldn't make.

You blink. The text settles.

The theater around you creaks with the particular language of old buildings—settling, you've always told yourself. Just settling. But the creak comes from the wrong direction tonight. From the stage. From underneath it.

You've heard the stories, of course. Every theater has them. But Maren's stories are different. She doesn't tell them like legends. She tells them like warnings.

*Something is different tonight.*

The lamp flickers again. Shadows on the stage shift without anyone casting them. And somewhere below—in that space beneath the boards that you've always tried not to think about too hard—something stirs.

You should find Maren.
