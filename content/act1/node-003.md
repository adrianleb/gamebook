## Node 003: The Stagehand's Gift

*The Wings — Props Storage*

Maren leads you through the narrow backstage corridors, past racks of faded costumes and flats painted with worlds that never were. You've walked this path a hundred times, but tonight the shadows seem to lean closer.

"Someone's here," Maren says, and her voice carries no alarm. "An old friend."

From between the prop shelves emerges a figure you've seen before but never truly noticed. The Stagehand. You've passed them countless times—fetching, carrying, always there when something needed moving. Their face is pleasant and utterly forgettable. You couldn't describe them if you tried.

"The Prompter," the Stagehand says. Their voice is soft, uncertain, as if they're not quite sure the words are theirs to speak. "The Stagehand remembers you. From... before? No. From now. The Stagehand remembers you from now."

You've never heard them speak directly to you before.

"The boundary is thin tonight," Maren explains. "Things from below are... more present. Including our friend here."

The Stagehand holds out a candle. It's unremarkable—a stub of white wax with a wick that's never been lit. But when you look at it, you feel something. The same almost-recognition you feel when a word is on the tip of your tongue.

"A gift," the Stagehand says. "For the work ahead. The Stagehand doesn't remember why, but..." They pause, reaching for something that isn't there. "It feels like the right thing to do."

To accept a gift from something that exists between worlds—that feels significant. Important. You should project confidence. Show that you belong here.

**[STAT CHECK: Stage Presence 1]**

**Success:** You accept the candle with a steady hand and a nod of acknowledgment. Something in your posture says: *I understand the weight of this.* The Stagehand's vague features shift into something almost like a smile.

"Yes," they say. "You understand. The Stagehand knew you would."

The candle feels warm in your palm despite never being lit. You sense it has a purpose—a use that will reveal itself when needed.

**Acquired: Rehearsal Candle** (Prop, Consumable)
*An unlit candle that carries the memory of light. When burned, it reveals hidden annotations in any scene—stage directions that were meant to be invisible.*

**Failure:** Your hand hesitates. The exchange feels strange—dreamlike in a way that makes you uncertain. But before you can fumble further, the Stagehand simply places the candle in your palm and steps back.

"It's alright," they say, and there's something like kindness in their voice—or the memory of kindness, copied from some scene they can't recall. "The Stagehand knows the Prompter is new to this. The gift waits until it's needed."

Maren places a steadying hand on your shoulder. "It's a lot to take in. But you're handling it."
