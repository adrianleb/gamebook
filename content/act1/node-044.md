## Node 044: Desperate Leap

*The Understage — The Crossing Point*

You don't have a plan. You don't have the authority to demand entry, the skill to slip past unnoticed, or the complete knowledge to invoke the old protocols. What you have is this: a need to move forward, and the willingness to trust yourself.

Sometimes that's enough.

You step toward the threshold without ceremony, without words, without strategy. You step toward it the way you'd step into any unknown—with your heart in your throat and your instincts screaming.

The Understage reacts. Of course it does. You're not claiming authority or sneaking past or invoking agreements. You're just... arriving. Like a character who wandered onstage at the wrong moment. Like an extra who doesn't know their lines.

But there's something honest about that. Something the Understage, with all its layers of narrative and performance, rarely encounters.

"What is this?" the collective voice murmurs, curious rather than hostile. "Not a Prompter's entrance. Not an intrusion. Something... improvised."

You keep walking.

**[STAT CHECK: Any 2]**

*This check can be met by ANY stat at threshold 2. It is designed as a safety valve for all builds.*

---

**Success:** The threshold accepts you—not gracefully, not with ceremony, but with a kind of chaotic momentum that carries you through. You tumble into the Understage the way a protagonist tumbles into the second act: undignified, unprepared, but undeniably *present*.

Stories scatter around you, making room. Not out of respect—out of sheer surprise. No one does it this way. No one just... shows up.

But you did.

The chaos of your entrance settles into something almost stable. You're standing in a space that might be a corridor, might be a stage wing, might be the margin between two different genres. You don't know where you are exactly. But you're in.

Behind you—already impossibly far—Maren's presence registers something like a laugh. Or maybe a sigh. Hard to tell.

The Understage's attention circles you, uncertain. You've broken the expected patterns. That makes you interesting. It also makes you a wildcard—unpredictable, uncategorized, potentially dangerous.

Reputation: complicated.

**Sets flag:** `CROSSING_DESPERATE`
**Sets flag:** `FIRST_CROSSING_COMPLETE`
**Relationship modifier:** "Wildcard" reputation—unpredictable, neither ally nor threat

**Failure:** The threshold accepts you—but not cleanly. Something snags. Something tears. You feel a wrenching sensation, and then you're through, but the crossing has cost you.

You stumble into the Understage, and as you catch your balance, you realize something is missing. Your hand goes to your pocket, your pack, your person—whatever you brought with you, something didn't make it through.

*A consumable item has been damaged in the crossing. If you have any consumable items, choose one to lose. If you have no consumable items, you enter with a lingering sense of wrongness—a narrative debt that may come due later.*

The chaos of your entrance settles. You're in. You're standing somewhere in the vast geography of the Understage. But the crossing marked you. The stories here can smell it—someone who arrived damaged. Someone who paid a price before they even began.

Behind you, Maren's presence registers concern. But you're already too far to hear her clearly.

The Understage watches. Waits. Assesses.

**Sets flag:** `CROSSING_DESPERATE`
**Sets flag:** `FIRST_CROSSING_COMPLETE`
**If consumable lost:** Remove one consumable item from inventory
**If no consumable:** Sets flag `CROSSING_DEBT` (narrative consequence in Act 2)

**Notes:**
- Any 2 Standard check per ACT1_MECHANICS.md (safety valve for all builds)
- Success: "Enter Understage chaotically but safely"
- Failure: "Enter Understage with -1 item (player chooses which consumable)"
- This option ensures every build can progress to Act 2
- The "wildcard" reputation is neutral—neither advantage nor disadvantage

**Design Intent:**
- The Desperate Leap exists for players who didn't optimize or made unusual stat choices
- No build should be locked out of Act 1 completion
- Success is satisfying (chaotic entrance as valid strategy)
- Failure has mechanical cost but doesn't create severe Act 2 disadvantage
- If no consumable items exist, the narrative debt creates future flexibility for authors
