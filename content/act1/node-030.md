## Node 030: First Contact

*The Threshold Stage — Backstage Corridor*

You turn toward the Runaway, but they're already gone—vanished into the rippling boundary like a stone dropped into dark water. That's not your path tonight.

Instead, your attention catches on movement in the wings. Another figure, watching from the shadows. Not the desperate, running kind. This one stands utterly still, observing with the patience of someone who has learned that rushing accomplishes nothing.

The Prophecy's Pawn.

You recognize the bearing from a thousand stories—the straight spine, the measured gaze, the hands held carefully neutral. Every gesture calculated to project heroic readiness. Except their eyes. Their eyes are too old, too knowing, for the "chosen one" they were written to be.

"Another handler," they say. Their voice carries the formal cadence of high fantasy dialogue, but there's rust beneath it—cynicism wearing through the performance. "Come to tell me I have a vital role to play? That my *unique gifts* are needed for the coming crisis?"

They step forward, and the boundary ripples around their feet like disturbed water.

"I've memorized that speech. I know how it ends."

This is the moment. The Runaway fled from confrontation. The Pawn is inviting it—testing you.

**[STAT CHECK: Stage Presence 2]**

You must project the right presence. Not authority—they've had enough of that. Not submission—they'll read it as manipulation. Something genuine.

**Success:** You don't step toward them. You don't step back. You simply exist in the space between, acknowledging their wariness without challenging it.

"I'm not here to tell you anything," you say. "I don't know your story. I don't know what role you were written for. But I know you chose to be here instead of there. That's worth understanding."

Something flickers in their expression. Not trust—not yet. But the absence of immediate dismissal.

"Understanding," they repeat. "That's a new approach. Usually it's *destiny* and *purpose* and *the greater good*."

They gesture toward a cluttered corner of the corridor, where old set pieces form a makeshift sitting area.

"Very well, would-be Prompter. Let's understand each other."

**Failure:** You reach for authority—the kind Maren projects so effortlessly. But the Pawn has spent their entire existence being told what to do by authoritative figures. They recognize the pattern instantly.

"Ah." Their mouth twists. "Another mentor. Another *guiding hand*. Do you have a mysterious backstory too? Secret knowledge you'll reveal in Act Three?"

The dismissal stings. But they don't leave. They're still talking, still testing. The door isn't closed—just harder to open.

Behind you, Maren clears her throat softly. When you glance back, she gives an almost imperceptible nod toward the Pawn. *Keep trying. Different approach.*

You take a breath and let the authority drain away. "I'm new at this. I don't have secret knowledge. I'm just trying to figure out what's happening."

The honesty catches them off guard. The suspicion doesn't vanish, but it dims slightly.

"New," they say. "Unscripted. Perhaps that's something."
