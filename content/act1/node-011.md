## Node 011: The Understage Border

*The Understage — Border Crossing*

You emerge from the tangled scenery into a space that feels... different. The chaos of layered sets and stacked props gives way to something more deliberate. A threshold.

The ground beneath you is marked. Lines painted in faded white, like stage blocking long forgotten. And ahead, where the Runaway has slowed, a wall of mist rises—not fog exactly, but the visual representation of a boundary. Beyond it, the Understage proper. Before it: the borderlands, where stories from above still hold partial sway.

The Runaway stands at the edge of the mist, chest heaving. They turn to face you.

"Stop," they say. And there's something in their voice—not just fear, but a desperate kind of hope. "Please. Just... listen. Before you drag me back."

They don't run further. Perhaps they can't, not yet. Perhaps they want you to understand.

"I know what I am," they continue. "A character. A function. Someone's romantic tragedy, written to die beautifully so a man could learn to love again." Their laugh is brittle. "I've read my ending. I've memorized my ending. 'She fell, and in falling, set him free.' That's my purpose. That's all I was ever supposed to be."

They step closer, and you see their eyes clearly for the first time. Wet. Desperate. Human in a way that shouldn't be possible for someone made of words and intention.

"But I chose differently. I *chose* to run. Doesn't that mean something? Doesn't that make me more than just... a plot device?"

The mist swirls behind them. The Understage waits.

**Notes:**
- This is a narrative transition node—no stat check
- Establishes emotional stakes and The Runaway's motivation
- Player choice affects dialogue flavor in Node 012 but not mechanical outcome
- The Runaway's signature line from CHARACTERS.md ("She fell, and in falling, set him free") appears here to establish their tragedy origin
- The border crossing creates a "point of no return" feeling without actually restricting options
