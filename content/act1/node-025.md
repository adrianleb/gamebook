## Node 025: The Breach Pattern

*The Prompter's Booth — Archive Alcove*

The pattern is larger than you imagined.

You've been thinking of tonight's breach as an isolated incident—a single character escaping, a single boundary weakening. But the records tell a different story. Breaches come in clusters. They build toward something.

You chart the dates on a scrap of paper, drawing lines between incidents. The clusters form a rhythm, almost tidal. Periods of stability lasting years, sometimes decades, then a sudden flurry of escapes. Then nothing. Then the cycle begins again.

The last major cluster was thirty-seven years ago. The same time Maren became the Prompter.

And if the pattern holds, tonight isn't the beginning. Tonight is the acceleration.

**[STAT CHECK: Script 2]**

You study the breach pattern, looking for the underlying cause. What triggers the clusters? What ends them?

**Success:** The answer is in the oldest notation, hidden in symbols you now understand. Breach clusters don't just happen. They're caused by narrative pressure—too many stories competing for too little audience. Too many characters dying badly and wanting something different.

The clusters end when someone relieves the pressure. Traditionally, the Prompter does this by entering the Understage and... doing something. The records are vague on specifics. But the previous Prompter went in thirty-seven years ago and didn't come back. Maren was supposed to retrieve them.

What Maren brought back instead was knowledge. And silence.

You understand now: the breach isn't just about the Runaway. The entire boundary is under strain. Something must be done, or the trickle becomes a flood.

**Failure:** The pattern is visible but the causation eludes you. You can see the clusters, track their frequency, but not explain why they happen or how they end.

Still, you have data. Dates. Intervals. Enough to make predictions, even without understanding the underlying mechanism.

The current interval suggests this won't be the last breach. More are coming. Soon.

**Notes:**
- Script 2 (Standard) check per ACT1_MECHANICS.md
- Success: Player understands breach clusters and their connection to Maren's past
- Failure: Player can predict but not explain
- Plants major plot seeds for Acts 2 and 3 (narrative pressure, previous Prompter)
