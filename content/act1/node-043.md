## Node 043: Negotiated Entry

*The Understage — The Crossing Point*

The old protocols. You remember reading about them—or hearing about them, perhaps from Maren, perhaps from the Prompter's Handbook, perhaps from the very structure of the Threshold Theatre itself. Prompters and the Understage have a relationship that predates written records. There are agreements. Courtesies. Ways of asking that are also ways of asserting.

You step toward the threshold and speak.

"By the right of the Prompt, I request passage. By the knowledge of the Script, I acknowledge your sovereignty. By the presence of my role, I enter as ally, not adversary."

The words feel old. Older than you. They resonate in ways that suggest they've been spoken before—by Maren, by her predecessor, by Prompters stretching back to the first time someone stood between a story and its ending.

The Understage stirs. Attention focuses—but differently than it would for a claim or an intrusion. This is recognition. You've spoken in its language.

A shape begins to coalesce from the threshold's edge. Not quite a character. Not quite an archetype. Something that exists specifically for this purpose: a guide. A liaison between worlds.

But it's testing you first.

**[COMBINED CHECK: Script 2 AND Stage Presence 2]**

*This check requires meeting BOTH thresholds. Having one stat at 3 does not compensate for the other being at 1.*

---

**Success (Both Checks):** The Guide-shape solidifies into something you can almost perceive. It's neither male nor female, neither old nor young. It wears the suggestion of a cloak and carries the implication of a lantern.

"The old words," it says, and its voice is the sound of pages turning and curtains rising. "Spoken correctly. Spoken with understanding. Welcome, Prompter-in-training. The Understage receives you as guest."

It gestures, and the threshold transforms. What was an uncertain boundary becomes something like a door—still liminal, still strange, but navigable.

"I will guide you to the Green Room," the Guide says. "The neutral space where all narratives may speak. From there, your path is your own. But for now... you enter under protection."

You step through with the Guide beside you. The Understage's attention follows, but without the predatory edge you might have felt otherwise. You've invoked the old agreements. The stories here will treat you as a legitimate presence.

Behind you, Maren's voice carries through: "Well remembered."

**Sets flag:** `CROSSING_NEGOTIATED`
**Sets flag:** `FIRST_CROSSING_COMPLETE`
**Relationship modifier:** Faction options are clear on arrival; Guide NPC available in Act 2

**Failure (One or Both Checks):** The Guide-shape flickers, half-formed. You've spoken the words—correctly enough—but something is missing. Either the knowledge isn't complete, or the presence isn't quite sufficient, or both.

"The old words," the Guide says, and its voice is thinner now, less certain. "Spoken... adequately. The Understage will allow passage. But..."

It wavers, struggling to maintain form.

"I cannot guide you. The invocation is incomplete. You enter with permission but without escort. The Green Room lies ahead—you can find it. Many have. But the way is longer, and you walk it alone."

The threshold opens—not as a door, exactly, but as a parting of curtains. Beyond, you can see the chaotic geography of the Understage: corridors that lead to other corridors, stages bleeding into stages, stories overlapping and contradicting.

The Guide dissipates. What's left is a faint sense of direction—not a path, but a suggestion of where the Green Room might be found.

You step through. The Understage acknowledges you, but distantly. You're permitted, not welcomed.

Behind you, Maren's voice: "You got through. That's what matters. The rest... you'll learn."

**Sets flag:** `CROSSING_NEGOTIATED`
**Sets flag:** `FIRST_CROSSING_COMPLETE`
**Relationship modifier:** Alone but known; must build reputation in Act 2

→ Go to Node 045 (The First Crossing Complete — Negotiated Entry)

**Notes:**
- Combined check per ACT1_MECHANICS.md: Script 2 AND Stage Presence 2 (both must pass)
- Success: "Enter Understage with a guide NPC"
- Failure: "Enter Understage alone but permitted"
- The Guide is a liminal entity specific to the crossing ritual
- This is the most demanding check but offers the clearest Act 2 advantage

**Design Intent:**
- Negotiated approach requires investment in multiple stats
- Rewards players who balanced their build
- The Guide NPC provides unique Act 2 opening opportunities
- Failure still grants legitimate entry, just without the escort benefit
