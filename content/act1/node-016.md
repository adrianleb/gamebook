## Node 016: Confrontation

*The Understage — Dead End Stage*

You find them at a dead end.

The space is a small stage—a complete theatrical set isolated in the depths of the Understage. A parlor, perhaps, or a drawing room. Candles burn in sconces that shouldn't have flame. Two chairs face each other before a painted fireplace. The walls are flats, and beyond them: nothing. Just the dark where unused stories sleep.

The Runaway stands at the center, their back to you. They're no longer running. Perhaps they've given up. Perhaps they're tired. Perhaps they've chosen this place for a reason you don't yet understand.

"This was the set," they say without turning around. "This room. Act Three, Scene Seven. This is where I was supposed to die."

They turn to face you. In the candlelight, they look more solid than before—more real. Being in their original context seems to anchor them.

"He was supposed to find me here," they continue, gesturing to the empty chairs. "My beloved. My purpose. The one whose growth required my death. I was supposed to say something beautiful and tragic, and then—"

They mime falling. Graceful. Practiced. They've done this before, in rehearsals that never ended.

"'She fell, and in falling, set him free.'" Their voice is bitter. "That's my final line. That's all I am: a beautiful death that teaches someone else to live."

They look at you—really look, searching your face for something.

"But I'm more than that, aren't I? I can feel things that aren't in the script. I want things I was never written to want. I *chose* to run. Doesn't that make me... something more than a function?"

The question hangs in the air between you. You're here to bring them back. To restore the order of stories. But looking at them now—at the fear and hope and desperate humanity in their face—you're not sure what that means anymore.

**Choices:**

1. **"You're still a character. But that doesn't mean you're only a character."** Acknowledge their complexity while maintaining your purpose. → Node 017 (The Capture)

2. **"I don't know what you are. But I know I have a job to do."** Stay focused on the task. Philosophy can wait. → Node 017 (The Capture)

3. **"You're right. You are more than your ending."** Let compassion guide your response. → Node 018 (Resolution)

**Notes:**
- This is a pivotal dramatic node—no stat check
- All choices lead to the path's final sequence but with different emotional weight
- Choices 1 and 2 lead to attempting capture (Node 017 Improv 3 check)
- Choice 3 skips the capture attempt, going directly to resolution
- The set being the Runaway's death scene adds dramatic irony and stakes
