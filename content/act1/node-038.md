## Node 038: Alliance or Distance

*The Threshold Stage — The Boundary's Edge*

The moment has come. The boundary shimmers before you, an invitation and a threat. Beyond it lies the Understage—and whatever answers you might find there.

But first, there's the question of the Pawn.

They stand apart from you and Maren, still calculating. Everything has been discussion until now—stories shared, vulnerabilities revealed, possibilities explored. But actions define alliances. Words are easy. Commitment is harder.

"I have to cross," you tell them. "The breach won't heal itself, and there's still the Runaway to deal with. One way or another."

The Pawn nods slowly. "I know."

"You could come with me. Use what you know about narrative structure to help navigate. Find your way to the Archives. Get answers."

Their eyes flicker toward Maren, then back to you.

"Or I could stay here. Wait for the dust to settle. See what kind of Prompter you turn out to be before committing to anything."

It's a fair point. Trust is still fragile between you. The conversation has opened doors, but walking through them is something else.

"What would it take?" you ask. "To come with me?"

The Pawn considers.

"Convince me," they say. "Not with promises you might not keep. With... presence. Show me that you're someone worth following into the unknown."

**[APPROACH CHECK: Stage Presence 3 OR Improv 2]**

**Stage Presence 3 Approach:** You stand tall, meeting their gaze with the quiet confidence of someone who knows their own worth—and respects theirs.

**Improv 2 Approach:** You adapt in the moment, reading their hesitation and responding with genuine flexibility rather than rehearsed persuasion.

---

**Stage Presence 3 Success:** You step forward, closing the distance between you. Not threatening. Not pleading. Simply present.

"I can't promise you answers. I can't promise safety. But I can promise this: you won't be a tool. Not to me. If we do this together, it's as partners. Your questions matter as much as my mission."

The Pawn is silent for a long moment. Then they reach into their tunic and withdraw something small: a pendant, intricately worked, marked with symbols you don't recognize.

"My story's sigil," they say quietly. "The mark of the Greymarch Prophecy. Worthless now—the story is incomplete without me. But it proves who I was. What I escaped from."

They press it into your hand.

"Keep it. As a token of alliance. When you show it, people will know we're connected. For better or worse."

**Acquired: Character's Token** (Token)
*A sigil from the Greymarch Prophecy. Proves alliance with The Prophecy's Pawn.*

"I'll come with you," the Pawn says. "Into the Understage. Into whatever comes next."

**Improv 2 Success:** You don't try to project authority—you've seen how the Pawn reacts to that. Instead, you adapt.

"You know what? I don't know if I'm worth following. I've been a Prompter for a few hours. I don't have secret wisdom or a grand plan. But I'm going into the Understage anyway, because that's where the answers are. And you want answers too."

You shrug, letting the uncertainty show.

"Maybe we figure it out together. Maybe we don't. But at least we'd be figuring it out, instead of waiting for someone else to write the next chapter."

The Pawn almost laughs—a surprised sound, genuine.

"You really aren't a mentor-type, are you? No wise pronouncements. No cryptic guidance."

"I don't know enough to be cryptic."

They shake their head, but something has shifted. They reach into their tunic and withdraw a pendant—a sigil from their original story.

"Here. A sign of... alliance, I suppose. We're in this together. However it turns out."

**Acquired: Character's Token** (Token)
*A sigil from the Greymarch Prophecy. Proves alliance with The Prophecy's Pawn.*

"Lead the way, Prompter. I'll tell you if you're walking into an obvious narrative trap."

→ Proceed to The First Crossing (Node 040)

---

**Failure (Either Approach):** You make your case, but something doesn't land. The Pawn wants to believe you—you can see it—but too many manipulators have seemed genuine at first.

"I... can't," they say finally. "Not yet. It's not that I don't believe you. It's that I can't afford to be wrong."

They step back from the boundary.

"Go into the Understage. Do what you need to do. If you come back—if you're still the person you seem to be now—then we can talk about alliance."

"And if I don't come back?"

"Then I'll know I was right to wait."

It's disappointing, but not hostile. They're protecting themselves. You can't blame them for that.

The Pawn doesn't offer a token. The alliance remains hypothetical.

**Choices:**

*This node resolves to The First Crossing (Node 040) based on check outcome.*

---

**Flags Set:**
- Success (either approach): `PAWN_ALLIED`
- Failure: `PAWN_NEUTRAL`
- *Note: `PAWN_HOSTILE` is not achievable on Negotiator path—requires antagonistic approach from other paths*

**Item Acquired (Success only):**
- Character's Token (Token) — proves alliance, affects Act 2 encounters

**Relationship Impact:**
- Success: Pawn accompanies player into Understage, provides narrative insight
- Failure: Pawn remains at Threshold, may reappear in Act 2 if player proves trustworthy

---

**Notes:**
- Combined check (Stage Presence 3 OR Improv 2) per ACT1_MECHANICS.md
- Path-defining outcome: determines whether Pawn becomes active ally or remains distant
- Character's Token per ACT1_MECHANICS.md item catalog
- Both success approaches lead to same outcome but with different flavor
- This node concludes the Negotiator path, proceeding to the convergence point (Node 040)
