## Node 013: The Wings

*The Understage — Where Stories Wait*

You step through, and the world changes.

The Wings are a transitional space—neither fully backstage nor truly onstage, but something between. Massive flats lean against walls that don't exist in the same direction as the ceiling. Pulleys hang from a sky that's painted midnight blue, complete with stars that occasionally blink. The floor is made of layered set pieces: a castle's flagstones blending into a drawing room carpet blending into forest loam.

The Runaway moves ahead of you, their movements more confident now that they're on familiar ground. They weave between hanging curtains and stacked furniture with the ease of someone who's spent a long time hiding.

"This is where we wait," they say over their shoulder. "Between readings. Between performances. Some of us have been waiting for centuries."

You pass a cluster of characters standing motionless—extras, perhaps, or minor roles. They're frozen mid-gesture, mid-conversation, mid-life. Their eyes don't track you as you pass, but you feel them watching anyway.

"Don't engage them," the Runaway warns. "They're in the pause between scenes. If you pull them out of it, they'll want to know their lines, and you can't give them any."

The path bends in ways geometry shouldn't allow. You pass through a doorframe that leads to a balcony overlooking a stage; the stage overlooks a dining room; the dining room opens onto the very corridor you just walked through. You're learning the Understage's first lesson: space is a suggestion here, not a rule.

Ahead, the Runaway slows. Their shoulders tense.

"We're not alone," they whisper. "Something else is following. Something that doesn't belong to any story I know."

A sound reaches you—not footsteps, but something worse. A scritching, scratching, *writing* sound. Like a pen dragging across paper, inscribing something into the fabric of this place.

The Runaway looks back at you. For the first time, their fear isn't of you.

"Run with me," they say. "Just for now. We can argue about my capture later."

**Choices:**

1. **Run with them.** Whatever's coming sounds worse than a fleeing character. You can resume the pursuit once the immediate danger passes. → Node 014 (Improvise a Trap)

2. **Stand your ground.** You're here to learn what you're dealing with. That includes whatever else lurks in the Understage. → Node 015 (Discovery)

---

**Notes:**
- This is a transitional narrative node—no stat check
- Introduces the Understage's impossible geography and waiting characters
- The scratching sound foreshadows The Editor's presence (Act 3 setup)
- Choice creates minor branch—both lead to the same eventual confrontation but via different emotional paths
- Running with the Runaway builds rapport; standing ground builds understanding
