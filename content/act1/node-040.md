## Node 040: The Threshold

*The Understage — The Crossing Point*

You've followed your path to its end. Whether you chased, studied, or negotiated your way here, all roads have led to this: the Crossing Point, where the Threshold Theatre's reality thins to almost nothing and the true Understage begins.

The space around you has been shifting for some time now—walls that don't quite meet at right angles, shadows that pool in impossible directions, props from a hundred different productions jumbled together like flotsam after a flood. But here, at the Crossing Point, even that chaotic order dissolves.

Before you stretches what can only be called a threshold. Not a door—there's no frame, no handle, no visible barrier. Just a place where the light changes. Where the quality of existence becomes different. Beyond it, you can see fragments: a corridor lit by gaslight, a forest glade under an impossible moon, a throne room whose walls shift between stone and text.

The Understage proper. Where stories go when they're abandoned. Where characters live out their narratives in endless repetition. Where the boundary between fiction and reality becomes meaningless because everything is both.

Maren stands beside you, her expression unreadable.

"This is as far as I can guide you," she says. "Beyond the threshold, you'll have to find your own way. The Understage responds to intention, to narrative weight, to the stories you carry with you."

She turns to face you directly. Her eyes, usually warm, hold something harder now.

"There are four ways to cross. Each teaches the Understage something different about you. Each opens different doors—and closes others."

She gestures toward the threshold.

"You can walk in directly. Announce yourself. Claim your place as a Prompter. It's bold. The Understage will respect strength, but it will also test it."

Her hand shifts, tracing the edge of the visible boundary.

"You can slip in quietly. Move through the spaces between scenes. The Understage doesn't track what it doesn't notice—but if you're caught sneaking, you'll be marked as an intruder."

She nods toward her own Prompter's Handbook.

"You can negotiate passage. Invoke the old agreements between Prompters and the Understage. It requires both knowledge and presence, but if you succeed, you'll enter with a guide who knows the terrain."

Finally, she sighs.

"Or you can simply... leap. Trust your instincts. React to whatever comes. It's chaotic, unpredictable, and you might lose something in the crossing. But sometimes the only way forward is through."

The threshold pulses gently, waiting.

**How do you cross?**

---

**Choices:**

1. **Enter directly.** Claim your authority as a Prompter. Let the Understage know what you are. → Node 041 (Direct Confrontation)
   - *Requires: Stage Presence*

2. **Slip in quietly.** Move between the seams. Enter unnoticed. → Node 042 (Stealth Entry)
   - *Requires: Improv*

3. **Negotiate passage.** Invoke the old protocols. Enter with understanding. → Node 043 (Negotiated Entry)
   - *Requires: Script AND Stage Presence*

4. **Take the desperate leap.** Trust yourself. React to whatever comes. → Node 044 (Desperate Leap)
   - *Requires: Any stat at threshold 2 (safety valve for all builds)*

**Notes:**
- This is the Act 1 convergence point where all three branch paths meet
- All paths from Node 005 (Pursuers, Researcher, Negotiator) lead here
- Each crossing method has different stat requirements per ACT1_MECHANICS.md
- The Desperate Leap option ensures all builds can proceed
- Maren's voice follows CHARACTERS.md: theatrical precision, stage metaphors, warm but not soft
- The description establishes the Understage's nature: liminal, theatrical, story-responsive

**Design Intent:**
- Create narrative weight for the Act 1 climax
- Present four distinct approaches that feel mechanically fair
- Foreshadow Act 2 consequences without locking players out
- Maren's guidance frames each option without judging
