## Node 012: Obstacle Encounter

*The Border Crossing — Understage Threshold*

You step forward, and the Runaway flinches back—but doesn't run. Not yet. They're watching you, measuring you, perhaps hoping you'll prove to be something other than a jailer.

"I have to understand what you are," you say. "Before I can answer anything."

They laugh—a broken, brittle sound. "What I *am*? I'm a character. A role. A function in someone else's story. I was written to love, to lose, and to fall beautifully so that *he* could learn from my death. That's what I am. That's all I was supposed to be."

Before you can respond, the threshold ripples. Something else is coming through.

It rises from the layered floors—a shape that's hard to focus on. A stagehand, perhaps, but rendered in shadow and suggestion. Its form keeps shifting: a painted backdrop, a rolling flat, a sandbag swinging on a rope. It blocks your path to the Runaway, and its voice, when it speaks, sounds like scenery being struck.

"No passage," it grinds out. "Not for the unprompted. Return to your script."

This isn't a character—it's something more fundamental. A rule of the Understage given form. The kind of obstacle that exists simply because stories need gatekeepers.

The Runaway's eyes widen. They recognize it, fear it.

"If you can't get past the Liminal," they whisper, "you can't follow me anyway."

**[STAT CHECK: Stage Presence 1]**

**Success:** You draw yourself up. You've watched Maren—the way she holds space, the way she commands attention simply by expecting it. You channel that now.

"I am the Prompter's apprentice," you say, your voice steady. "I carry the authority of the Booth."

The Liminal hesitates. Its shifting form stills, focusing on you. Something in it recognizes the claim—not the truth of it, necessarily, but the *conviction*. In a place where story matters more than fact, conviction can be enough.

Slowly, grudgingly, it flows aside.

"Prompted," it acknowledges. "Pass. But the Understage remembers."

You move forward. The Runaway stares at you with something new in their expression—not quite respect, but close.

**Failure:** You try to project authority, but the words come out uncertain. The Liminal looms larger, its form pressing toward you like a closing curtain.

"Not prompted," it declares. "Not permitted."

For a moment, panic rises in your throat. But then—a sound behind you. A creak of floorboards, deliberately loud.

The Stagehand emerges from shadows you didn't realize were there. They don't speak to the Liminal, don't challenge it. They simply place a gloved hand on your shoulder—and something shifts.

The Liminal's attention wavers. When it looks at you again, it sees... something it didn't before. An association. A permission.

"...Prompted," it admits, though it sounds confused. "Pass."

The Stagehand releases your shoulder and steps back into the shadows. You don't have time to thank them—or to wonder how they got here. The Runaway is already moving.

**Notes:**
- This is a Basic (threshold 1) check per ACT1_MECHANICS.md
- Success: Player asserts authority independently
- Failure: The Stagehand assists, reinforcing their mysterious helpful nature
- The Liminal is an environmental obstacle, not a character—part of the Understage's operating logic
- Both paths proceed to Node 013 with the same narrative position
