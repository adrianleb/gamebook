## Node 024: Connecting the Dots

*The Prompter's Booth — Archive Alcove*

The documents pile up around you. Dates. Names. Incident reports. Cross-references. You're building a map of something that was never meant to be mapped—the topology of escape, the architecture of breach.

The Stagehand brings you tea at some point. It tastes like stage curtains and dust, but you drink it anyway. Maren checks in once, her expression unreadable, then leaves you to your work.

The candle has burned down to a stub when you finally see it. The connection that links everything together.

It's not just timing. It's not just genre. It's resonance.

Breaches happen when something in the theater—a performance, a reading, even just a rehearsal—echoes the emotional core of a trapped character's story. The Runaway escaped during a tragedy rehearsal, when an actress spoke lines about doomed love. Somewhere in the Understage, the Runaway heard an echo of their own fate and pushed against the boundary.

But the records show something else, too. Multiple resonances. Multiple escapes. The Runaway isn't alone down there. Something else came through tonight—or tried to.

**[STAT CHECK: Improv 2]**

You need to connect the disparate clues. The old notation, Maren's incident reports, the timing of tonight's breach. There's a second escapee—you're sure of it. But finding them in the records requires intuition as much as analysis.

**Success:** There. A notation you almost missed—not a breach but a "boundary softening," documented just hours before the Runaway's escape. Something from a horror story. Something that burns cold.

Page 113. The Revenant. They're here too.

You now understand what you're dealing with: two escapees, two genres, two completely different motivations. The Runaway wants to live. But the notation suggests the Revenant wants something else entirely.

**Failure:** The connection remains frustratingly unclear. You can see the shape of the pattern but not its details. There's a second presence, you're certain—the records hint at it. But which character? Which story?

You'll have to proceed with partial information. Sometimes research only takes you so far.

*This node resolves directly to Node 025 based on check outcome.*

**Notes:**
- Improv 2 (Standard) check per ACT1_MECHANICS.md
- Success: Player identifies The Revenant as second escapee
- Failure: Player knows there's a second escapee but not their identity
- Both paths proceed; failure path means later Revenant encounter is a surprise
