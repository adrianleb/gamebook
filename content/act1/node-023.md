## Node 023: The Pattern Emerges

*The Prompter's Booth — Archive Alcove*

You spread the documents across the reading table—the modern files alongside the ancient notation. Centuries of breach incidents, rendered in different hands, different systems, different eras. And now, looking at them together, you begin to see what connects them.

Not coincidence. Pattern.

The Stagehand hovers at the edge of the candlelight, watching you work. They seem fascinated by your process, as if they've never seen someone study like this. Or perhaps as if they've forgotten what it looks like.

The pattern isn't in the characters who escape. It's not in the stories they flee. It's something else—something about timing.

You have two threads to follow. Both might lead somewhere useful. Neither is guaranteed.

The first thread: the calendar. Breach incidents cluster around specific dates. They seem connected to theatrical seasons, to premieres and closings, to moments when the boundary between performance and reality grows thin.

The second thread: the Stagehand's translations. They mentioned cold. Burning. Page 113. Specific enough to be meaningful. If you could find the original story they referenced, you might understand more about how escapes actually work.

Time is limited. The Runaway is still out there, and the breach won't seal itself. You should focus your research.

**Choices:**

1. Follow the calendar pattern. When do breaches happen? → Node 024
   - *Focuses on prediction and prevention*
   - *May reveal upcoming breach timing*

2. Track down the original story. Find the cold one, the one who burned. → Node 024
   - *Focuses on understanding escape mechanics*
   - *May provide insight into the Runaway's situation*

3. Ask the Stagehand what they remember about their own origin. → Node 024
   - *Sets flag: `STAGEHAND_CURIOUS`*
   - *Opens revelation path in Act 2*
   - *May distract from immediate research*

**Notes:**
- Choice node (no stat check) per ACT1_MECHANICS.md
- All choices lead to Node 024 but with different context
- Choice 3 sets the STAGEHAND_CURIOUS flag, which opens Act 2 content
- The "cold one, the one who burned" refers to The Revenant
