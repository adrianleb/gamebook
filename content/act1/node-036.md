## Node 036: The Pawn's Truth

*The Threshold Stage — Near the Boundary*

The boundary ripples between you and the Understage. In its shimmering surface, you catch glimpses of what lies below—passages and chambers that seem to shift, spaces that hold stories within stories. Somewhere down there, the structure of narrative itself is maintained. Or failing to be maintained.

"I should tell you something," the Pawn says. "Something I haven't told anyone since I arrived."

They turn from the boundary, and you see something new in their expression. Fear, yes—but also resolution. They've made a decision.

"I didn't just escape my story. I *understand* it now. I spent years in the margins before I found my way out. Reading ahead. Reading back. Learning how the narrative machinery works."

Their voice drops.

"I know things about how stories function. Useful things. Things that could help you understand why the boundary is failing, what's happening in the Understage. But that knowledge makes me dangerous. To the wrong people, I'm not just an escaped character. I'm a threat to narrative stability itself."

The confession hangs in the air. This is more than vulnerability—it's trust extended at great risk.

"Why are you telling me this?" you ask.

"Because you asked what I want." Their eyes meet yours. "I want to understand my own creation. And the only way to do that is to go deeper. Into the Understage. Into the Archives where stories are recorded. I need access that an escaped character can't get alone."

The implication is clear. They're offering an alliance. But they're also testing you—will you see them as a resource to exploit, or a person to collaborate with?

**[STAT CHECK: Stage Presence 3]**

This is the advanced test. Everything you've built leads here. Can you demonstrate that you see them as a partner, not a tool?

**Success:** You don't hesitate.

"Then we go together. You help me understand what's happening to the boundary. I help you get to the Archives. We figure out what you actually are—and maybe what I'm supposed to be doing—along the way."

The Pawn breathes out slowly. For a moment, you see something you haven't seen before: relief. Pure, uncomplicated relief.

"You meant it," they say quietly. "The uncertainty, the questions—it wasn't an act. You really don't know what you're supposed to do with me."

"I know what I want to do. I want to help."

They nod slowly. "Then perhaps... perhaps we can help each other."

For the first time since you met them, the Pawn smiles. It's small, cautious, but genuine.

"The Prompter who sees through narratives and the character who escaped one. We might be useful together."

**Failure:** You try to respond, but something in your approach still carries the weight of agenda. Maybe you're thinking too hard about what their knowledge could mean for your mission. Maybe you unconsciously shift into *handler* mode.

The Pawn sees it. Their expression closes slightly—not hostile, but guarded again.

"You're considering the strategic value," they observe. "What I could offer. How my knowledge might serve your purposes."

"That's not—"

"It's fine." They hold up a hand. "I'm not offended. I escaped one story where I was a means to an end. I recognize the pattern when I see it."

They step back, creating distance.

"I'm still willing to share what I know. But not as an asset. Not as a resource. If we work together, it's as equals with separate goals that happen to align. Nothing more."

It's a lesser offer than you might have had. But it's still an offer.
