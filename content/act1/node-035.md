## Node 035: Building Trust

*The Threshold Stage — Backstage Corner*

The conversation has shifted. What started as interrogation has become something closer to dialogue. The Pawn is still wary—you can see it in how they hold themselves, always ready to withdraw—but the hostility has faded.

"You're different from what I expected," they admit. "The Prompters in stories are always... certain. They know the rules. They enforce them. You seem genuinely uncertain about what the rules *should be*."

"I'm learning them as I go," you say. "Which means I get to decide how I apply them."

The Pawn considers this.

"Choice. That's what I wanted. What I escaped for. The freedom to make a genuine decision that wasn't written into my arc."

They move toward the boundary—not to escape, but to observe it. The rippling surface throws distorted reflections of both of you.

"In my story, I was never allowed to be uncertain. The prophecy said I would triumph, so every doubt was just... narrative tension. Something to overcome. My mentor reassured me. My allies believed in me. Even my moments of weakness were designed to make the eventual victory more satisfying."

Their voice drops.

"Do you know what it's like to realize that your entire inner life was stage direction?"

**[STAT CHECK: Stage Presence 2]**

This is the moment. The Pawn is vulnerable, open, reaching for connection. Can you meet them there authentically?

**Success:** You join them at the boundary's edge. Not too close—respecting their space—but present.

"I don't know what that's like," you say. "Not exactly. But I know what it feels like to realize someone else has been writing your choices. I've spent my whole life following paths that were set for me. Getting here, becoming this—" You gesture at the Prompter's Booth behind you. "It's the first time I've felt like I might actually be making decisions."

The Pawn turns to look at you. Really look, not assess.

"Then we have something in common after all. Two people at the beginning of unscripted stories."

Something relaxes between you. Not friendship—not yet. But the beginning of trust.

**Failure:** You try to meet the moment, but something in your response rings false. Maybe you reach too eagerly for connection. Maybe you sound like you're performing empathy rather than feeling it.

The Pawn notices. Of course they notice—they've spent their existence distinguishing genuine emotion from scripted reaction.

"That was almost convincing," they say, not unkindly. "You want to understand. You're trying. But you're still thinking about what understanding *gets* you."

They turn back to the boundary.

"I don't blame you. Everyone has an agenda. Even escaped characters trying to find meaning in a world that wasn't designed for them."

The distance between you solidifies slightly, but doesn't become impassable. They're disappointed, not hostile.

**Choices:**

*This node resolves directly to Node 036 based on check outcome.*

---

**Notes:**
- Stage Presence 2 check per ACT1_MECHANICS.md (Standard difficulty)
- Tests whether player can build genuine connection versus transactional one
- Success path: player and Pawn bond over shared experience of unscripted choice
- Failure path: Pawn recognizes player's agenda-driven approach but doesn't reject them
- Both paths lead to Node 036, but relationship quality affects advanced check difficulty
