## Node 020: The Records Room

*The Prompter's Booth — Archive Alcove*

You turn away from the rippling stage. The Runaway watches you go with something like confusion—they expected pursuit, perhaps. Or confrontation. Not retreat.

But you're not retreating. You're preparing.

Maren nods, almost imperceptibly. She knows what you're doing. In her voice, you hear echoes of old lessons: *The Understage doesn't care about good intentions. It cares about knowledge. Know the story before you enter it.*

Beyond the booth's main chamber, a narrow passage leads to the Archive Alcove—a cramped space stuffed with filing cabinets, yellowed ledgers, and boxes of production records stretching back decades. Maybe centuries. The theater's history is layered here like geological strata, each era's documentation buried beneath the next.

If anyone has escaped before, there will be a record. The Prompters have always documented everything.

The question is whether you can find what you need before the boundary tears any further.

**[STAT CHECK: Script 2]**

You scan the filing system, searching for breach incident reports. The organization isn't intuitive—it follows some archaic system that prioritizes narrative type over chronology.

**Success:** Your training serves you well. You recognize the filing conventions from the Handbook's appendices and navigate directly to the breach documentation section. Within minutes, you've located a thin folder marked *BOUNDARY INCIDENTS: ACTIVE.*

**Failure:** The system resists you. You pull file after file, finding costume receipts, lighting diagrams, reviews from newspapers that no longer exist. Minutes slip away. Eventually, Maren appears at your shoulder.

"Third cabinet from the left," she says quietly. "Category: Unscripted Departures."

She hands you a folder and withdraws. Her expression suggests you'll have to learn these systems eventually—but not tonight.
