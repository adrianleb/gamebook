## Node 026: The Prediction

*The Prompter's Booth — Archive Alcove*

Maren finds you among the scattered papers, your tea long cold, the Rehearsal Candle burned to nothing but a nub of wax. She doesn't ask what you've learned. Perhaps she already knows. Perhaps she's been waiting for someone to figure it out.

"You found the pattern," she says. It's not a question.

"I found more than that." You tap the chart you've made—dates, intervals, clusters. "The next breach. I think I can predict where it will happen. Not just when—where."

Her expression flickers. Something between hope and fear.

"The boundary isn't uniform. It weakens at specific points—places where stories have ended badly, where the emotional residue is strongest. If the pattern holds, the next breach will happen at..." You trace the intervals, calculate the resonance. "The old horror wing. The storage area where they keep the gothic sets. Tonight, or close to it."

Maren is quiet for a long moment. Then she moves to one of the locked cabinets—the one you hadn't been able to open—and produces a small brass instrument. It looks like a compass, but the needle spins lazily and the cardinal points are marked with symbols rather than directions.

**[STAT CHECK: Script 3]**

She offers it to you. "The Genre Compass. It indicates the dominant narrative type of wherever you're standing. In the Understage, that information can mean the difference between walking into a romance and walking into a tragedy."

**Success:** You take the compass. The needle steadies as you hold it, pointing toward a symbol you now recognize from the archaic notation—a glyph representing horror.

"You've earned this," Maren says. "Your research has been... thorough. More thorough than I expected. The next breach will happen in the horror wing, and you'll be ready for it."

The compass feels warm in your hand. Warm, and somehow expectant.

**Acquired: Genre Compass** (Script)
*A brass instrument that indicates the dominant genre of your current location. In the Understage, it spins toward danger—and opportunity.*

**Failure:** You take the compass, but something doesn't quite click. The needle spins aimlessly in your hand, responding to your presence but not settling. You can sense its potential without unlocking it.

"The Compass needs attunement," Maren says carefully. "It responds to understanding. Your research is good—but perhaps not quite complete. Keep it. It may settle as you learn more."

She doesn't take it back. That itself is a gesture of faith.

The horror wing, then. The next breach will happen there. But you'll be going in without the Compass's guidance fully available—at least for now.
