## Node 010: The Chase Begins

*The Threshold Stage — Descending*

The Runaway runs.

One moment they're frozen at the edge of the rippling stage; the next, they're gone—plunging through the boundary like a diver breaking water. The surface of reality shudders where they passed, and for an instant you see it: the Understage below, vast and dark and layered like the backdrops of a thousand productions stacked impossibly deep.

Maren doesn't try to stop you. She only says, "Remember: down there, story matters more than fact. Act like you belong, and you might."

You don't have time to ask what that means. The boundary is already sealing, the ripples fading. If you're going to follow, it has to be now.

You step forward—and fall.

The descent isn't a fall so much as a transition. The world turns inside out. Gravity becomes a suggestion. You land on... something. A floor that's part wooden stage, part painted canvas, part velvet curtain piled in drifts. The air smells of dust and greasepaint and something older underneath.

Ahead, you catch movement. The Runaway, already running, their silhouette weaving between hanging flats and stacked set pieces. They glance back once—surprised you followed, perhaps—then vanish around a corner that shouldn't exist.

The chase is on.

**[STAT CHECK: Improv 2]**

**Success:** You don't think. You *react*.

The Understage shifts around you, but you move with it—ducking under a descending sandbag, vaulting over a prop throne, cutting through a painted forest that somehow has depth. Your instincts adapt faster than your understanding.

When you round the impossible corner, the Runaway is closer. They're panting now, their grace faltering. They hadn't expected pursuit this immediate, this committed.

"You're faster than I thought," they admit, not slowing. "But you can't catch me. This is my world now."

You've gained ground. The chase continues, but on your terms.

**Sets flag:** `PURSUIT_STRONG_START`

-> Go to Node 011 (The Understage Border)

**Failure:** You chase—but the Understage doesn't cooperate. Every shortcut closes before you reach it. Every straight line curves away. You're learning the hard way: this place doesn't follow rational geography.

The Runaway pulls further ahead. When you finally reach the impossible corner, they're almost out of sight.

But then—a gloved hand catches your elbow. The Stagehand, somehow here, guides you through a gap between two flats you hadn't noticed.

"This way," they whisper. "The Stagehand knows the shortcuts the characters forget."

You emerge closer than you should be. Not close enough to catch the Runaway, but close enough to keep them in sight. The Stagehand is already gone, dissolved back into the scenery.

-> Go to Node 011 (The Understage Border)

**Notes:**
- This is a Standard (threshold 2) check per ACT1_MECHANICS.md
- Success: Player gains ground, sets PURSUIT_STRONG_START flag for later checks
- Failure: The Stagehand assists, maintaining proximity but no advantage
- Both paths proceed to Node 011 with the chase established
- The descent establishes the Understage's theatrical unreality
