## Node 004: The First Breach

*The Threshold Stage*

The creak comes again—louder now, more insistent. Maren's head snaps toward the stage. The Stagehand has already vanished, dissolved back into the shadows between prop shelves as if they were never there.

"Stay close," Maren whispers. "And whatever happens, don't run. Running invites chase scenes."

She leads you to the edge of the stage, where the wings meet the performance space. The ghost light—a single bare bulb on a stand, center stage—flickers in a rhythm that feels deliberate. The shadows around it are wrong. They're moving against the light, not with it.

And then you see it.

A figure is emerging from the stage floor. Not climbing through a trapdoor—the boards are solid. The figure is simply *rising*, as if the stage were water and they were surfacing for air. Their costume is antiquated: a flowing gown, pale silk, edges blurred like a photograph left in the sun.

They look at you. Their eyes are desperate, terrified, *human* in a way that makes your heart clench.

"Please," they whisper. The voice carries across the empty theater, intimate and vast at once. "I can't go back. Don't make me go back. I know how it ends—I've read my ending. 'She fell, and in falling, set him free.' I *refuse*."

This is a breach. A character escaping their story. Everything Maren warned you about. Everything you're supposed to prevent.

But they're looking at you like you're their only hope.

**[STAT CHECK: Improv 1]**

**Success:** You don't freeze. You don't panic. Instead, you find yourself doing what comes naturally—you improvise. You keep your body still, your expression open, and you speak in a voice that's calm without being cold.

"I'm listening," you say. "No one's sending you anywhere until I understand."

The figure's desperate expression shifts—surprise, then the first fragile edge of hope. The tension in the theater doesn't break, but it... eases. You've bought time. You've kept the scene from spiraling into something neither of you can control.

Maren catches your eye. There's something new in her look: the beginning of respect.

**Failure:** Your body goes rigid. The sheer *wrongness* of it—a person emerging from solid wood, fiction spilling into reality—freezes you in place. A half-formed sound escapes your throat, something between a question and a warning.

The figure flinches at your reaction, takes a step back. For a moment, you think you've ruined everything.

But Maren steps forward, placing herself between you and the breach. Her voice is steady, practiced—decades of handling exactly this.

"We're not here to harm you," she says. "But you know you can't stay."

The figure's eyes dart between Maren and you. The moment stabilizes, but you sense you've started on the back foot. You stumbled—but you didn't fall.

Maren glances at you. Not disappointed, but assessing. "Next time," she murmurs, "remember: they're as scared of you as you are of them. Usually more."
