## Node 042: Stealth Entry

*The Understage — The Crossing Point*

You study the threshold—not the obvious boundary, but the edges. The places where the light doesn't quite meet the dark. Every stage has them: the gaps between scenes, the moments when no one is watching, the spaces that exist only because someone forgot to write them out.

You've always been good at finding those spaces.

Instead of walking through the threshold, you approach at an angle. Not quite there. Not quite here. Existing in the transition itself.

The Understage pulses with attention—but not toward you. It's watching the threshold, waiting for someone to cross. It doesn't think to check the margins.

You slip sideways, through a gap that shouldn't be a gap, into a space that shouldn't be a space.

**[STAT CHECK: Improv 3]**

**Success:** The transition is seamless. One moment you're at the edge; the next you're inside, and the Understage never registered your arrival. No collective voice demanding credentials. No archetypes assessing your worth. Just... silence. And shadows. And the endless rustle of stories playing out in the dark.

You're in.

From this angle, you can see the Understage differently than if you'd walked through the front door. You can see the *seams*. The places where one narrative bleeds into another. The shortcuts and hidden passages that only exist for those who aren't officially present.

Behind you—far behind now, though distances are strange here—you sense Maren watching. Approving. She can't see you anymore, but she knows you made it.

The Understage's attention sweeps past like a searchlight, and you step out of its path without thinking. This is how you move here now. In the margins. In the spaces between.

**Sets flag:** `CROSSING_STEALTH`
**Sets flag:** `FIRST_CROSSING_COMPLETE`
**Relationship modifier:** CHORUS (Act 2) approaches you first—they recognize margin-walkers

**Failure:** You almost make it. The gap accepts you, the transition begins—but at the last moment, something snags. A loose thread of narrative. A character's peripheral vision. A story that happened to include "and someone was watching from the shadows."

You stumble into the Understage proper, half-hidden, half-exposed.

The collective attention doesn't focus on you directly. But it registers your presence—a flicker of "something's there" that ripples through the nearby narratives.

"A shadow," the Understage murmurs to itself. "Not a character. Not a Prompter. Something... between."

You're in. You're not caught, exactly. But you're not invisible either. The stories here have noticed that something is moving through their margins. They'll be watching for you now.

From the distant threshold, Maren's presence—not her voice, but her awareness—carries a single message: *You made it. That's what matters. But watch your back.*

**Sets flag:** `CROSSING_STEALTH`
**Sets flag:** `FIRST_CROSSING_COMPLETE`
**Relationship modifier:** Genre Representatives (Act 2) investigate who's been watching

**Notes:**
- Improv 3 Advanced check per ACT1_MECHANICS.md
- Success: "Enter Understage unnoticed"
- Failure: "Enter Understage observed but unchallenged" (proceed with suspicion)
- Emphasizes the Improv stat's connection to finding unexpected paths
- Fail-forward: Both outcomes allow progression to Node 045

**Design Intent:**
- Stealth approach suits Improv-focused builds
- The check is Advanced (threshold 3) reflecting the difficulty of slipping past the Understage's awareness
- Success grants unique insight into the Understage's hidden geography
- Failure creates awareness without immediate consequence—a slower burn
