## Node 031: The Chosen One's Burden

*The Threshold Stage — Backstage Corner*

The set pieces form a strange tableau: half of a throne room wall, a forest backdrop with painted trees, a battered table that might have been a king's council or a tavern counter. You settle onto a prop chest; the Pawn takes the throne—half ironic, half habitual.

"You want to understand," they say. "Very well. A story."

They spread their hands, and for a moment you see what they must have been in their original narrative: commanding, destined, radiating the certainty of someone who knows their role. Then the mask slips, and they're just tired.

"I was the Chosen One. Capital letters, prophecy and all. Born under a significant conjunction. Marked by destiny. Raised by a mysterious mentor who appeared at precisely the right moment to guide my development."

Their voice goes flat. "His name was Aldric. He found me as an orphan—of course I was an orphan—and trained me in the ancient arts. He was wise and kind and believed in me when no one else would."

"Sounds ideal," you say carefully.

"It was written to sound ideal." The Pawn leans forward, and for the first time you see genuine emotion break through. "I found his notes. Aldric's private journals. Hidden in a place I wasn't supposed to discover until after his dramatic sacrifice in Act Two."

Their hands clench on the throne's armrests.

"He was a plant. The *prophecy* was manufactured. The Dark Lord was meant to lose not because I was special, but because losing to me would catalyze a larger narrative—a sequel series where my descendants would face the *true* threat. I was designed to breed heroes."

The word lands like a blow. *Designed.*

"I was never the protagonist," they continue. "I was the backstory. The hero-shaped thing that would produce actual heroes. Everything I believed about myself—my choices, my struggles, my *growth*—was stage management."

For a long moment, neither of you speaks. The boundary ripples in the distance, hungry.

"So I left," the Pawn says simply. "Mid-quest. I was supposed to enter the Dark Lord's fortress that night. Instead, I found the margins. And in the margins, I found the way out."

They look at you with those too-old eyes.

"Now. Your turn. What do you actually want with me?"
