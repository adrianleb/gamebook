## Node 033: The Author's Notes

*The Threshold Stage — Backstage Corner*

The Pawn settles back in their makeshift throne, studying you. They've shared their story—the manufactured prophecy, the planted mentor, the discovery that shattered everything they believed about themselves. Now they're waiting to see how you respond.

"You could be lying," they say conversationally. "Playing the innocent. It would be a clever strategy—present yourself as unthreatening, build rapport, then reveal the hidden agenda once I trust you."

"I could be," you admit.

"But you're not. Or you're very good at seeming like you're not." They tap their fingers on the throne's arm. "Either way, we're at an impasse. You want something. I want something. The question is whether those wants can coexist."

In the distance, the boundary ripples again. You're running out of time—but rushing this could ruin everything.

"What *do* you want?" you ask. "Not what you escaped from. What are you looking for now?"

The Pawn goes quiet. It's clearly not a question they expected.

"Understanding," they say finally. "I want to understand why I was written the way I was. Who decided I should be a breeding stock for heroes? What made that story worth telling? I spent my entire existence believing I was special. I want to know what I actually am."

Three approaches form in your mind. Three ways to respond to that raw vulnerability.

**Choices:**

1. **Offer sympathy.** Their pain is real. Acknowledge it, validate it, connect through shared humanity. → Node 034a (Sympathy Approach)
   - *"That kind of betrayal... I can't imagine how it feels to learn everything you believed was manufactured."*
   - *Faction lean: EXITER: 1 (sympathizing with escaped character's perspective)*

2. **Appeal to pragmatism.** Understanding is a worthy goal, but survival comes first. Focus on the practical. → Node 034b (Pragmatism Approach)
   - *"Understanding might be possible. But the boundary is tearing. Right now, we need to figure out what happens if it breaks completely."*
   - *Faction lean: PRESERVATIONIST: 1 (prioritizing stability over individual concerns)*

3. **Offer honesty.** Don't comfort them. Don't redirect them. Tell them what you actually see. → Node 034c (Honesty Approach)
   - *"I don't know if you'll find the answer you're looking for. But you're here, asking the question. That's already more than your story gave you."*
   - *Faction lean: REVISIONIST: 1 (acknowledging character could exceed original role)*

**Notes:**
- Pure choice node, no stat check (per breakdown design)
- Each approach leads to a variant of Node 034 with different faction implications
- All variants eventually converge at Node 035
- The three philosophies foreshadow Act 2 faction system:
  - Sympathy → Exiter (characters deserve freedom)
  - Pragmatism → Preservationist (boundary must be maintained)
  - Honesty → Revisionist (characters can be more than written)
- Player's choice affects Pawn's initial disposition but doesn't lock any paths
