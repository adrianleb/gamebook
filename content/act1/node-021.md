## Node 021: The First Clue

*The Prompter's Booth — Archive Alcove*

The folder is thin—disturbingly so. For all the centuries of theatrical history contained in this alcove, there are only a handful of documented breaches. Either they're exceptionally rare, or the documentation is incomplete.

Or someone has been removing records.

You spread the contents across a reading table. A Rehearsal Candle—one of the old ones, the kind that supposedly reveals hidden annotations—sputters to life as you work, though you didn't light it.

The documents inside follow a pattern. Each breach report is divided into three sections: *Origin* (the escaped character's source material), *Manifestation* (how they appeared in reality), and *Resolution* (how they were returned). The resolution section is often the shortest—a single word like "Reclaimed" or "Negotiated" or, once, simply "Lost."

The most recent entry catches your attention. The handwriting is older—Maren's, you recognize, from before her script became trembling. The date is thirty-seven years ago.

*Origin: Tragedy, domestic. Minor role—serving girl, scene 4.3. Spoke three lines total. Died offstage.*

*Manifestation: Appeared in the wings during a production of King Lear. Attempted to warn Edmund. Caused a fifteen-minute delay.*

*Resolution: [The entry is smudged, almost deliberately obscured. Only one word is legible:] "Complicated."*

Thirty-seven years. That's almost exactly when Maren became the Prompter. Coincidence seems unlikely in a place that runs on narrative logic.

You need older records. The ones written in the archaic notation that predates modern theatrical conventions. The Stagehand might know where those are kept.

**Choices:**

1. Ask the Stagehand about older records → Node 022
2. Search the deeper archives yourself → Node 022

**Notes:**
- This node is narrative-focused; no stat check
- Plants seeds about Maren's past connection to breaches
- Both choices lead to Node 022 but establish different character dynamics
- The thirty-seven years detail connects to CHARACTERS.md (Maren's forty years as Prompter, previous Prompter died)
