## Node 017: The Capture

*The Understage — Dead End Stage*

You've made your choice. Whatever sympathy you feel, whatever questions linger, you have a duty. Characters can't simply escape their stories without consequence. The boundary between fiction and reality exists for a reason.

The Runaway sees it in your eyes. The hope drains from their face, replaced by resignation—and then, beneath that, determination.

"Then I won't make it easy," they say. "I've played my death scene a thousand times. But I've never played a chase scene. Let's see how well you improvise."

They move—and the set moves with them. The painted fireplace swings aside, revealing a gap in the flats. The chairs slide across the floor as if pushed by invisible stagehands. The candles flare and dim in patterns that seem deliberate.

They're not just running. They're using the story-space itself as a weapon.

**[STAT CHECK: Improv 3]**

**Success:** You don't fight the shifting set—you *use* it. When a flat swings toward you, you duck behind it and emerge on the other side, cutting off their escape route. When the floor seems to tilt beneath your feet, you roll with the motion, letting it carry you forward instead of throwing you off balance.

The Understage responds to story logic. And right now, the story is: a pursuer closes in on their quarry.

You catch them at the edge of the set, where the painted world ends and the void begins. They stumble—and you catch their arm. Gentle enough not to hurt. Firm enough that they can't pull free.

For a moment, you're both still. Their breathing is ragged. Their eyes are wet. But they don't struggle.

"Captured," they whisper. "That's a new ending for me."

**Sets flag:** `RUNAWAY_CAPTURED`

**Failure:** You chase them through the shifting set, but the Understage knows them better than it knows you. Every shortcut you try leads to a dead end. Every grab comes up just short. The story-space protects its own—even those who are trying to escape.

Finally, exhausted, you're forced to stop. The Runaway watches you from a platform that shouldn't exist, elevated above you like an actress taking a curtain call.

"You can't catch me by force," they say, breathing hard. "I've been playing this scene longer than you've been alive. But—" They pause, considering. "You followed me this far. Into my own story. That means something."

They don't run again. Not because they can't—but because something in this pursuit has shifted between you.

"Maybe," they say slowly, "we can negotiate."

**Notes:**
- This is an Advanced (threshold 3) check per ACT1_MECHANICS.md
- Success: Sets RUNAWAY_CAPTURED flag—character is physically caught
- Failure: Capture fails but leads to negotiation opportunity (fail-forward)
- Both paths proceed to Node 018 but with different power dynamics
- The set actively participating in the chase reinforces story-as-environment theme
