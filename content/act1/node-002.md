## Node 002: Maren's Test

*The Wings — Stage Left*

You find Maren in her usual spot, half-hidden by the curtain folds, her silver hair catching the ghost light's glow. Forty years she's worked this theater. Forty years of watching, waiting, prompting. Her eyes—still sharp despite everything—are fixed on the stage.

"You felt it too." It's not a question. Maren doesn't waste words on questions she already knows the answers to.

"Something's wrong," you say. The words feel inadequate.

"Something's been wrong for weeks." She finally looks at you, and there's something in her expression you've never seen before. Not fear, exactly. Recognition. "The boundary is thinning. Characters are... testing it."

She gestures at the darkened stage. "Tell me what you see. Not with your eyes—with your training. What is a prompter's role when the script goes wrong?"

**[STAT CHECK: Script 1]**

**Success:** You know this. The words come from somewhere deeper than memory—from the Handbook, from Maren's lessons, from something that might be instinct. "To recognize the deviation. To identify what's been changed, what's been added, what's been *removed*." You pause. "And to decide whether to correct it or let the new version play."

Maren's expression shifts. Approval, and something else—relief. "Good. You understand more than I thought. That's... good. We don't have time for a gentle introduction."

**Failure:** The training is there, somewhere, but it scatters when you reach for it. "To... keep the actors on track? To prompt when they forget their lines?"

Maren sighs—not unkindly, but with the weariness of someone who hoped for more. "That's the surface work. The work you've been doing." She turns fully toward you, and suddenly she looks every one of her years. "A prompter's true role is to recognize when the script itself has changed. When something that was never written begins to perform."

She studies your face, then nods slowly. "You'll learn. We don't have the luxury of time anymore, but you'll learn. Come—I need to show you something."

**Notes:**
- Both paths lead to Node 003 but with different relationship context
- Success: `MAREN_TRUST_HIGH` track begins (1/2 toward flag)
- Failure: Neutral relationship continues
