## Node 014: Improvise a Trap

*The Understage — The Prop Graveyard*

You run.

The Runaway leads and you follow, the two of you weaving through the labyrinth of the Wings. Behind you, the scratching sound grows louder—then abruptly stops. Whatever was following has lost interest, or found something else to write about.

The Runaway slows, panting, and you find yourselves in a different kind of space. Broken props surround you: shattered swords, collapsed thrones, a chandelier lying in glittering ruin. This is where the Understage discards things that no longer serve the story.

"The Prop Graveyard," the Runaway says, catching their breath. "Nothing here is dangerous. It's all been... retired."

They're watching you now with something like curiosity. The temporary alliance of the run has shifted something between you.

"You could have let me go," they observe. "Whatever that scratching thing was, it would have distracted you long enough for me to vanish. But you followed instead."

They step back, putting a broken mirror between you. Their reflection fragments into a dozen versions of themselves, each one wearing a different expression.

"I'm not going back," they say. "I can't. You must understand that by now."

But you haven't come this far to lose them. This graveyard of retired props... there's opportunity here. If you're clever. If you can improvise.

**[STAT CHECK: Improv 2]**

**Success:** You act before thinking—which is exactly what improv requires. You grab the fallen chandelier's chain and *pull*.

The chandelier swings like a pendulum, its crystal fragments catching what light exists in this place and scattering it in blinding patterns. The Runaway flinches back, their reflection-selves fragmenting further—

And stumble directly into a coil of velvet rope. Stage rigging. Heavy, constraining, and now wrapped around their ankles.

They fall, not hard, but enough. When they look up at you, there's surprise in their expression. Even grudging admiration.

"That was clever," they admit. "I underestimated you."

You've cornered them. The chase isn't over, but the dynamic has shifted decisively in your favor.

**Failure:** You reach for the chandelier, but it's heavier than you expected—and the Runaway is faster than you gave them credit for. They're already moving, darting between the broken props with a grace born of desperation.

You give chase, knocking aside a toppled throne, ducking under a hanging curtain. They're slowing—you're close—

But when you round a corner, they're gone. The space has shifted, as it does here. A door that wasn't there before hangs open.

You didn't catch them. But you found something else: papers scattered on the ground where they stood. Notes. Records. Someone's been tracking them.

**Notes:**
- This is a Standard (threshold 2) check per ACT1_MECHANICS.md
- Success: Player corners the Runaway, skipping to direct confrontation
- Failure: Player discovers plot information instead—fail-forward with different reward
- Both paths eventually lead to Node 016 (via different routes)
- The Prop Graveyard establishes that the Understage discards as well as preserves
