## Node 116: The Bleeding Fragment

*The Green Room — The Dressing Rooms*

The Dressing Rooms are a maze of mirrors and memory. Each door opens onto a space that belongs to a different story—here a Hollywood starlet's vanity, there a samurai's armor stand, beyond that a cluttered student's apartment from some coming-of-age tale. The occupants are absent, or hiding, or never existed in the first place.

CHORUS whispers guide you deeper, their voices overlapping: "*He hides where stories forget to look—*" "*—in the margins, the ellipses—*" "*—follow the sentence that never ends...*"

You track the unfinishedness through the Dressing Rooms like following a scent. Dialogue on posters trails off mid-word. Props lose their purpose—a sword becomes unclear about being a sword. The contamination is subtle but unmistakable to someone who knows how stories should work.

At the end of a hallway that shouldn't have an end, you find a door smaller than the others. Child-sized. Pencil-sketched. Its handle is warm when you touch it.

**[STAT CHECK: Script 2]**

**Success:** You recognize the patterns—the author's abandoned style, the consistent inconsistency of an unfinished work. Before you open the door, you understand what you're walking into. A story fragment, isolated and afraid, desperate for the structure it's never known.

The door opens smoothly. The room beyond is a sketch of a room—walls implied rather than drawn, furniture suggested in confident strokes that never quite connect. And in the center, sitting on a bed that doesn't quite exist, is the boy.

He's perhaps eight years old, or was meant to be. His features shift slightly when you're not looking directly at them—the author died before settling on the exact shape of his nose, the precise color of his eyes.

**Bleeding Fragment:** "You found me." His voice is soft, unfinished. "Most people can't. Most people don't notice the..." He gestures at himself. "The incomplete parts."

**Failure:** You push through the Dressing Rooms, but the contamination confuses your tracking. Doors lead to the same rooms. Halls loop back on themselves. The Fragment's unfinishedness infects your sense of direction.

By the time you find the small door, you're disoriented, uncertain. You push it open too quickly, and the room beyond shifts—the boy is gone, fled through a window that wasn't there a moment ago.

CHORUS whispers: "*He runs—*" "*—try again—*" "*—or chase him through the margins—*"

You can try a different approach, or chase him through the Green Room's forgotten spaces.

**Flags Possible:**
- Retry allows alternative approach (Stage Presence 2 for commanding presence that makes him curious)
