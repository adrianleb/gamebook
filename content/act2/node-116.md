## Node 116: The Bleeding Fragment

*The Green Room — The Dressing Rooms*

The Dressing Rooms are a maze of mirrors and memory. Each door opens onto a space that belongs to a different story—here a Hollywood starlet's vanity, there a samurai's armor stand, beyond that a cluttered student's apartment from some coming-of-age tale. The occupants are absent, or hiding, or never existed in the first place.

But something is wrong here. Wronger than the usual Understage strangeness.

The first sign: a romance heroine's vanity mirror reflects a battlefield instead of her face. You watch as her carefully arranged perfume bottles slowly transform into spent shell casings. She hasn't noticed yet. When she does, her story will break.

The second sign: in a noir detective's dressing room, the perpetual rain outside his window has turned to snow. Not narrative snow—not the meaningful, Christmas-card kind. Just... wrong precipitation. His trench coat hangs confused on its hook, uncertain whether it should be wet or frosted.

CHORUS whispers guide you deeper, their voices overlapping: "*He hides where stories forget to look—*" "*—in the margins, the ellipses—*" "*—follow the sentence that never ends...*"

You track the unfinishedness through the Dressing Rooms like following a scent. Dialogue on posters trails off mid-word. Props lose their purpose—a sword becomes unclear about being a sword. The contamination is subtle but unmistakable to someone who knows how stories should work.

A children's fairy tale bleeds into a war memoir. A love letter's ink runs across the page to form casualty lists. In one dressing room, you find a comedy and tragedy mask fused together—not the traditional theatrical pairing, but *literally* merged, one face trying to smile and weep simultaneously, frozen in an expression that is neither.

This is what the Bleeding Fragment does. Not malice—just incompleteness so profound it destabilizes everything nearby. Stories forget their genres. Characters lose their archetypes. The narrative grammar of the Understage itself begins to fracture.

You understand now why the Preservationists fear him. Not because he threatens to destroy stories, but because he threatens to make them *meaningless*—endings without resolution, conflicts without stakes, characters without the consistency to be loved or hated.

At the end of a hallway that shouldn't have an end, you find a door smaller than the others. Child-sized. Pencil-sketched. Its handle is warm when you touch it.

**[STAT CHECK: Script 2]**

**Success:** You recognize the patterns—the author's abandoned style, the consistent inconsistency of an unfinished work. Before you open the door, you understand what you're walking into. A story fragment, isolated and afraid, desperate for the structure it's never known.

The door opens smoothly. The room beyond is a sketch of a room—walls implied rather than drawn, furniture suggested in confident strokes that never quite connect. And in the center, sitting on a bed that doesn't quite exist, is the boy.

He's perhaps eight years old, or was meant to be. His features shift slightly when you're not looking directly at them—the author died before settling on the exact shape of his nose, the precise color of his eyes.

**Bleeding Fragment:** "You found me." His voice is soft, unfinished. "Most people can't. Most people don't notice the..." He gestures at himself. "The incomplete parts."

**Failure:** You push through the Dressing Rooms, but the contamination confuses your tracking. Doors lead to the same rooms. Halls loop back on themselves. The Fragment's unfinishedness infects your sense of direction.

By the time you find the small door, you're disoriented, uncertain. You push it open too quickly, and the room beyond shifts—the boy is gone, fled through a window that wasn't there a moment ago.

CHORUS whispers: "*He runs—*" "*—try again—*" "*—or chase him through the margins—*"

You can try a different approach, or chase him through the Green Room's forgotten spaces.
