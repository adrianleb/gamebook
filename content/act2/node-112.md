## Node 112: Heroic Alliance

*The Green Room — A Quiet Corner*

The Unfinished Quest leads you away from their throne to a corner where the noise of the Green Room fades to a murmur. They move differently now—not the statue waiting for purpose, but something more alive. More present.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "The Exiters want to help characters escape their stories. Noble goal. But—" They pause, searching for words that don't come from a script. "But escape to what? I walked away from my destiny. I'm free." They gesture at the empty air. "And now what? I train. I wait. I look for meaning in a place where meaning is manufactured."

They lean against the wall, and for a moment they look terribly young.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "There's something happening. The Exiters are organizing—not just helping individuals escape anymore. They're planning something bigger. A way out that works for everyone." Their eyes meet yours. "But it's dangerous. The Director opposes it. The Preservationists see it as existential threat. And maybe they're right."

They push off the wall, restless energy returning.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "I've been asked to help. To use my skills—my heroic training, my prophecy-breaking—to scout a path that others can follow." A humorless laugh. "Another quest. But this time, I get to choose it."

They study you with the intensity of someone used to reading companions, to knowing who can be trusted when the battle turns.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "You understood choice. You saw me as more than my role. So I'm asking: will you help me find this path? Not as a follower—I've had enough of those. As an equal."

They need to know you can think beyond the expected, beyond the script. That you can suggest possibilities that aren't already written.

**[STAT CHECK: Improv 2]**

**Success:** You don't just agree. You offer something they hadn't considered—a different angle, a creative approach to the problem of escape. An idea that comes from you, not from any narrative template.

The Unfinished Quest's eyes light up with something that might be hope.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "That's... yes. That could work. That's not a hero's answer or a sidekick's answer. That's a *person's* answer." They clasp your shoulder with a warrior's grip. "You'll come with me. When the time comes, when the path is clear—we'll walk it together."

Their voice drops.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "The Exiters are meeting soon. A gathering to plan the next phase. I can get you in—as my ally, not their recruit. See for yourself what they're building. Decide then if it's worth fighting for."

**Failure:** You try to offer something original, but what comes out sounds like variations on themes they've heard before. Familiar tropes dressed in different words.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "Ah." The light in their eyes dims slightly. "You mean well. But you're still thinking in chapters and arcs." They pat your shoulder, not unkindly. "Perhaps that's not wrong. Perhaps I'm the one who's confused."

They return to their contemplative stance.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "The offer stands. When you're ready to think outside the story, find me. The quest will still be here. It's always here."
