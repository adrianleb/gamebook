## Node 100: Green Room Arrival

*The Green Room — Threshold*

The stairs down from the First Crossing end at a door that shouldn't exist. It's painted a shade of green that shifts when you look at it directly—forest, then jade, then something that isn't quite a color at all. A brass plaque reads: THE GREEN ROOM. Beneath it, in smaller letters: ALL STORIES WELCOME. NONE REQUIRED.

You push the door open.

The space beyond defies the architecture that should contain it. The Green Room sprawls in all directions, a vast backstage lounge that seems to have been assembled from the fragments of a thousand theaters. Mismatched furniture clusters in conversation groups—a Victorian fainting couch beside a modern sectional, a circle of director's chairs around a coffee table made from an old steamer trunk. The lighting shifts subtly as you watch: warm amber fading to cold blue fading to the particular artificial brightness of dressing room bulbs.

Characters move through the space. You recognize them not as individuals—not yet—but as types. A woman in noir shadows nurses a drink at the bar. A figure in fantasy armor sits motionless, staring at nothing. Near the far wall, a cluster of identical-looking people speak in overlapping voices. And at the center of it all, presiding from an elevated platform, sits someone whose posture radiates authority.

The Director. You've heard Maren mention them. *They manage this space,* she said. *Neutral territory. The only thing down here that is.*

The Director hasn't looked at you yet. They're speaking with a nervous figure clutching a stack of papers—some kind of assistant or supplicant. But you sense they know you're here. Everything in this room probably knows you're here.

Closer to the entrance, movement catches your eye. A collective of figures flows through the margins of the space—extras, background characters, the unnamed faces that populate every story. CHORUS. They whisper among themselves, and you catch fragments: *new arrival* and *Prompter-touched* and *should we tell them?*

You stand at the threshold. The Green Room waits.
