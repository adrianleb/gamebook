## Node 113: Survival Lessons

*The Green Room — The Back Passages*

The Final Girl leads you through passages you hadn't noticed before—spaces between the main areas, maintenance corridors that the Green Room seems to hide from casual observation. She moves with practiced silence, and you find yourself matching her rhythm.

**The Final Girl:** "First lesson." She doesn't slow down. "Everyone here thinks they're the protagonist. Main character syndrome. They walk around like the story's about them." She glances back at you. "The story's never about one person. It's about whoever survives long enough to tell it."

You emerge into a small, forgotten space—a dressing room that looks like it hasn't been used in years. Dust covers the mirrors. Costumes hang like ghosts.

**The Final Girl:** "This is where I come when I need to think. No one looks for you in the places that don't matter." She sits on an old trunk, gesturing for you to join her. "You want to know what's really happening in the Green Room? Forget the factions. They're all playing the same game with different rules."

She leans forward.

**The Final Girl:** "The Director isn't neutral. They're *performing* neutral. Every decision they make benefits someone—usually themselves, sometimes the Preservationists. CHORUS knows it. I know it. Now you know it."

She taps the mirror beside her. The reflection is subtly wrong—you can see it now that she's pointed it out. The angles don't quite match.

**The Final Girl:** "And there's something else. Something in the margins that even CHORUS is afraid to talk about." Her voice drops. "I've seen red ink marks on things that should be permanent. Fixed. Unchangeable. Someone's editing the Green Room itself—and they're being very careful not to be seen."

She studies you, assessing.

**The Final Girl:** "You want the Independent path? No faction loyalty, no safety net? It's harder. But you see things the factions miss because they're too busy believing their own stories."

This isn't about charm or cleverness. It's about pattern recognition—can you see the significance of what she's showing you?

**[STAT CHECK: Script 2]**

**Success:** You look at the mirror again. At the room. At the patterns of dust and disuse. And you see it—the room isn't forgotten. It's hidden. The dust is too even, too deliberate. Someone maintains this place while pretending not to.

**You:** "This room is a blind spot on purpose."

**The Final Girl:** Her smile is the first truly warm one you've seen from her. "There it is. Pattern recognition. Most people see 'abandoned' and stop looking." She stands. "This is where Independent thinkers gather. Not a faction—just survivors who compare notes."

She offers you something small—a button, unmarked.

**The Final Girl:** "Keep this. When you need to find this room again, hold it and think of dust and mirrors. The Green Room will remember." Her voice hardens. "The factions are all dancing to music someone else is playing. The question is whether you want to dance—or find the musician."

**Failure:** You look at the room, but you see what you're supposed to see: an abandoned space, a forgotten corner. The pattern is there, but you're not reading it right.

**The Final Girl:** "Hmm." She doesn't seem disappointed, exactly. Just... unsurprised. "Not everyone sees it. That's not a failure—it might even keep you safer. Sometimes seeing too much is worse than seeing too little."

She leads you back toward the main Green Room.

**The Final Girl:** "If you decide the factions aren't for you—if you want to find your own path—come back. The room will still be here. The patterns will still be here. Maybe next time you'll see them."
