## Node 122: Revision Attempt

*Inside the Story — The Narrative's Edge*

You've found the point of revision: the moment before the story begins. It exists as a kind of margin, a white space where the "Once upon a time" hasn't yet been spoken. Here, the Eternal Princess is just a girl standing at a crossroads. The tower is a possibility, not a destiny.

The narrative pushes back. Three hundred years of telling have given this story weight, momentum. Changing its beginning is like trying to redirect a river with your hands.

**Eternal Princess (as she might have been):** "I feel it." She stands beside you, flickering between versions—the trapped princess, the waiting girl, the person she was before the story claimed her. "The story wants me to turn left. The tower is left. But if I turn right..."

Her voice breaks.

**Eternal Princess:** "What's right? I've never known what's right. There's only ever been the tower."

This is the creative heart of revision. You're not just changing a plot point—you're giving a character options she's never had. The responsibility is immense.

**[STAT CHECK: Stage Presence 3]**

**Success:** You speak with the authority of someone who understands stories and the people trapped inside them. The princess deserves a choice—a real choice, not a narrative mandate.

**You:** "Right is a village where you become a blacksmith. Or a path to the sea where you become a sailor. Or a road to the castle where you become something the story never imagined." You steady your voice against the narrative's pressure. "The revision takes hold when *you* decide. Not the story. You."

The Eternal Princess closes her eyes. When she opens them, they're clear for the first time in centuries.

**Eternal Princess:** "I want..." She hesitates, tasting possibility. "I want to not be saved. I want to save someone else. I want the story to be about what I *do*, not what happens to me."

The narrative shudders. Three paths appear:

→ The princess saves herself and claims her own story → Node 123
→ The story ends naturally, with peace instead of rescue → Node 124
→ The princess steps out of the story entirely → Node 128

**Failure:** Your voice isn't strong enough. The narrative is older than you, more practiced, more certain of its shape. The revision attempt fails—not completely, but messily. The princess turns right, but the tower appears anyway, relocated by a story that refuses to be rewritten.

**Eternal Princess:** "No. No, it always—"

The loop reasserts. But something is different now. The tower is cracked. The rescue, when it comes, feels hollow. The story is damaged, not revised.

**CHORUS (troubled):** "*The revision took—*" "*—but not cleanly—*" "*—unintended consequences—*" "*—we must assess—*"

The result is imperfect—the princess is aware of her loop now, unable to forget, but equally unable to escape. It's better than before, maybe. Or maybe it's worse.

→ Accept the imperfect outcome → Node 124 (compromise resolution)
→ Try again (requires faction token or ally assistance) → Node 122 (with bonus)
