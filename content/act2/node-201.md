## Node 201: The Stacks

*The Archives — The Stacks*

The Stacks swallow you whole.

Shelves rise on all sides, their heights lost in the perpetual twilight above. The organization here follows no system you recognize—books arranged by the color of their protagonists' eyes, perhaps, or the precise temperature at which their villains first felt regret. Handwritten labels in a hundred different hands mark sections: "DEATHS (HEROIC)," "LOVE INTERESTS (UNREQUITED)," "PROPHECIES (IRONIC)." Some shelves simply read "DELETED."

The air here is thick with possibility. Pages flutter without wind. Words appear on your skin and fade—fragments of exposition trying to attach themselves to a new story.

You've come to search. The question is how deeply you're willing to look.

The Understudy hovers at the entrance to the Stacks, watching you with something between hope and apprehension. They gesture toward the labyrinthine shelves.

**The Understudy:** "The Stacks have a... logic. Not a logic you can learn, but one you can feel if you let yourself. The trick is not to look for what you want. You have to let it find you." They pause. "I've heard that advice from three different sources. I still don't know what it means."

You move deeper into the shelves. The light changes—sometimes candlelight, sometimes starlight, sometimes the gray glow of a screen in a dark room. Around you, the whispers grow louder. Not words yet, but the shapes of words, waiting to be read.

This is the moment of the search.

**[ARCHIVE SEARCH: Script 2]**

Focus your attention. Let your thoughts become questions. The Stacks respond to those who approach them correctly.

**Deep Find (Script 3+):** The shelves part for you. A manuscript slides free of its own accord, landing in your hands—exactly what you need and something more. Information about the disturbances in the Archives. Evidence of someone writing where they shouldn't be. The text mentions "the Editor" by name, and describes a pattern: stories being revised in red ink, characters disappearing, entire narratives being... overwritten.

And there's a bonus: a loose page tucked between chapters. A margin note, in handwriting that matches nothing in the manuscript itself: *"If they find the Author's Desk, we lose everything. —E"*

**Standard Find (Script 2):** Your search yields results. A manuscript emerges from the chaos—information about the disturbances, hints about unauthorized editing in the Archives. The text is fragmented but clear enough: someone has been changing stories that were meant to stay fixed. The evidence points deeper into the Archives, toward a place called "the Author's Desk."

It's not everything, but it's enough to follow.

**Partial Find (Script 1):** The Stacks offer you something, but it's incomplete. A torn page here. A fragment of margin notes there. You sense the shape of the information you need without grasping its substance. There are disturbances. Someone is responsible. The trail leads somewhere important. But the specifics elude you, scattered across shelves you can't quite reach.

You'll need to look elsewhere—or come back with better questions.

**Lost (Script 0):** The Stacks close around you.

For a timeless moment, you're nowhere. The shelves stretch in every direction, and every direction is the same direction. Your name feels like a word you've read but never spoken. The stories whisper louder, offering you roles, offering you pages, offering you endings that aren't yours.

Then a hand catches your arm. The Understudy, their face pale but determined.

**The Understudy:** "Breathe. Remember who you are. The Stacks want to write you into something—don't let them."

Their voice anchors you. The disorientation fades, leaving only the embarrassment of having been swallowed by the shelves and the practical problem of having found nothing useful.

You'll need to search elsewhere.

**Notes:**
- The Archive Search uses Script as the primary stat, with tiered results based on the roll.
- `DEEP_FIND`, `STANDARD_FIND`, and `PARTIAL_FIND` flags determine the content of Node 204.
- Getting lost costs time but not progress; the player can try again or pursue other approaches.
