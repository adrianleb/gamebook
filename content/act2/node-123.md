## Node 123: Revisionist Resolution

*Inside the Story — The New Beginning*

The revision takes hold.

The story reshapes itself around the princess's choice—not violently, not with the sound of breaking things, but with the quiet certainty of a river finding a new course. The tower isn't there anymore. It never was. Instead, there's a girl who walked into the dragon's lair by herself and said, "I think you're lonely. I think we both are."

The dragon, it turns out, wasn't a dragon. It was another trapped narrative, another creature waiting for its role to change. In the revised tale, they become companions. Adventurers. The princess saves villages, slays tyrants, and is saved in turn when she needs it—because everyone needs saving sometimes, and that's not weakness.

The story ends not with "happily ever after" but with "and the journey continued." It's an ending that's also a beginning.

**Eternal Princess (as she is now):** "I remember." She stands in the Green Room, solid and present in a way she wasn't before. "I remember the tower. All three hundred years of it. But I also remember..." She looks at her hands, callused now from imagined sword work. "I remember being the one who *chose*."

The Happy Ending approaches, and their expression is complicated—triumph and grief and something like envy.

**The Happy Ending:** "You did it. You gave her what every character deserves: a story that belongs to her."

They produce a pen—elegant, silver, clearly significant.

**The Happy Ending:** "The Revisionist's Pen. Use it once, and you can revise a minor element of any narrative. Not a whole story—that takes more than a tool. But a word, a moment, a choice point..." They press it into your hand. "The ability to edit is the ability to grant agency. Use it wisely."

**CHORUS (celebrating):** "*A new tale—*" "*—a free princess—*" "*—the loop is broken—*" "*—revision succeeds—*"
