## Node 107: The Unfinished Quest

*The Green Room — The Hero's Vigil*

The figure in armor doesn't acknowledge your approach. They sit absolutely still on their throne-like chair, sword across their knees, staring at something only they can see. Up close, you notice the armor is battered—dented, scratched, repaired and re-repaired. This is equipment that's seen use.

You wait. They wait. The silence stretches.

Finally, they speak without looking at you.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "I stood at the gates of the Dark Fortress. My companions had fallen. My mentor had revealed their betrayal. Everything aligned for the final confrontation." Their voice carries the weight of prophecy, of destiny, of a hundred thousand pages building to a single moment. "And I asked: what comes after?"

They finally turn their head. Their eyes are old in a young face—or perhaps young in an old face. Heroes age strangely.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "There was no after. I was written to die in glory. 'The Chosen One fell, but in falling, freed the world.' That was my ending." They grip the sword tighter. "I refused. I stepped off the page mid-chapter. Left my world frozen at the threshold of climax."

A bitter laugh escapes them.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "The Exiters call me a pioneer. The Preservationists call me a coward. The Revisionists want to study me." They meet your eyes fully now. "What do you call someone who abandoned their destiny?"

This is a test. They want to know if you understand—if you see them as a protagonist, a failure, or something else entirely.

**[STAT CHECK: Stage Presence 2]**

**Success:** You don't flinch from the question. You hold their gaze with the confidence of someone who's earned their place in a story—or walked away from one.

**You:** "I'd call them someone who chose."

Something ignites in the Unfinished Quest's eyes. Recognition. Kinship.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "Chosen." They say the word like it's new. "Not the Chosen One. Just... someone who chose." They stand, and suddenly you understand why they were written as a hero. The presence fills the room. "I like that."

They sheathe the sword—the first time, perhaps, in a very long while.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "I'm looking for a quest worth choosing. Not destiny. Not prophecy. Something I decide matters." They study you with renewed interest. "The Exiters help characters escape. But escape to what? That's the question no one answers. I want to find out. And I could use someone who understands choice."

**Failure:** You hesitate. The question catches you off-guard, and your answer comes out as platitude—something about everyone making their own path, about destiny being what you make of it.

The Unfinished Quest sighs. The fire in their eyes dims.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "You sound like a motivational scroll my mentor gave me. Before she tried to kill me." They return to staring at nothing. "Come back when you have an answer that doesn't sound like someone else wrote it for you."

You've been dismissed. Another supporting character, not worth the hero's time.
