## Node 129: Mission Abort

*The Green Room — The Retreat*

The escape fails. Whether by choice or circumstance—the observer's intervention, the Widow's loss of nerve, your own second thoughts—the mission ends without the Exit being used. The back passages feel colder on the return journey.

The Widow is returned to her story. You can still feel her grief from here—genuine now, not just performance. She was so close to something else, and now she's back in the only role she's ever known, but with the memory of almost escaping.

The Unfinished Quest finds you in one of the Green Room's quieter corners. Their disappointment is obvious, but it's tempered by something like understanding.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "It didn't work." Not a question. They've seen this before. "She's back in the Third Act. Weeping for a husband she never knew."

They sit down beside you, suddenly less heroic, more human.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "I don't blame you. Or her. The Exit is..." They search for words. "It's not just a doorway. It's a leap of faith. And faith is hard when you've spent centuries being told exactly what you are."

They produce the compass from their belt, but don't offer it.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "Some escapes take multiple attempts. Some characters never make it. But the fact that she *tried*—the fact that you *helped*—that matters." They meet your eyes. "The Preservationists will see this as a victory. 'The natural order restored.' But we know the truth: she was *this close*. And next time, she might be braver. Or you might be more persuasive. Or the Director might be watching someone else."

They stand, and their heroic demeanor returns—a costume they're more comfortable wearing than vulnerability.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "The Exiter path isn't about success. It's about *possibility*. You've proven that you're willing to help someone try. That counts for something."

The mission is failed, but not completely. The Widow's near-escape will affect the Green Room's politics. The Preservationists are pleased, but wary. The Revisionists are intrigued. And the Exiters have marked you as someone who tried.
