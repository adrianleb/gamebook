## Node 133: Understudy's Invitation

*The Green Room — The Third Corridor*

The Understudy straightens as you approach, and for a moment their exhaustion is replaced by something like hope. They've been waiting for someone—anyone—to take this route, and the fact that it's you seems to matter.

**The Understudy:** "Prompter. I'm glad it's you." They glance down the corridor behind them, then back to you. "I know we haven't spoken much, but I've been... observing. You handle the Green Room's politics without losing yourself in them. That's rare."

They gesture for you to follow, and the corridor opens into a small, private study—clearly the Understudy's personal space. Notes cover every surface. Diagrams of the Archives' layout. Fragments of text in handwriting that isn't quite consistent.

**The Understudy:** "I need to get into the Archives. Deep into the Archives. And I can't do it alone—partly because of how it looks, and partly because..." They hesitate. "Because I'm not sure I trust myself to come back."

They pull a manuscript from the cluttered desk. The pages are old, fragile, and marked with annotations in red ink.

**The Understudy:** "I've been researching my own origin. Where I came from. Who wrote me." Their hands shake slightly. "I found something. Something that suggests I'm not... original. That I might have been copied from someone. Or something. Or that I was written to *replace* someone."

The weight of this confession hangs in the air. The Understudy is offering you partnership, but they're also offering you a mystery—and possibly a danger.

**The Understudy:** "Come with me. Help me find the truth. In exchange, I'll share everything I learn about the Archives, about the... disturbances the Director keeps mentioning, about all of it." They meet your eyes directly. "I know I'm asking a lot. But I don't have anyone else to ask."

The invitation is genuine. So is the desperation behind it. Whatever the Understudy has discovered, it's eating at them—and they're willing to accept help from a relative stranger rather than face it alone.
