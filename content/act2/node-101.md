## Node 101: The Director's Introduction

*The Green Room — The Director's Platform*

You cross the lounge floor toward the elevated platform where The Director holds court. Characters step aside as you pass—not deferentially, but warily, the way minor roles make room for someone who might matter to the plot. You feel their eyes on your back. Evaluating. Categorizing.

The nervous figure with the papers scurries away as you approach, leaving The Director alone. Up close, they're harder to look at directly. Their features seem borrowed from a dozen different authority figures—studio executive, theater impresario, benevolent dictator. They wear a costume that shifts subtly depending on the angle: sometimes a tailored suit, sometimes elaborate robes, sometimes something simpler. Their eyes don't shift. Their eyes are fixed on you.

**The Director:** "Another one from above. You have the look of a Prompter about you—that particular weariness around the edges. Maren's work, I assume?"

They don't wait for confirmation. They already know.

**The Director:** "I've managed this space for longer than your theater has existed. Every character who passes through these doors is my responsibility. They come here to rest, to negotiate, to escape the demands of their narratives. And I ensure they don't... exceed their roles."

Their smile doesn't quite reach their eyes.

**The Director:** "The question is: what role will you play here? Are you a messenger from above, come to observe and judge? Or something more interesting?"

You sense this is a test. The Director is measuring you—not just your words, but how you hold yourself. Whether you flinch.

**[STAT CHECK: Stage Presence 2]**

**Success:** You meet The Director's gaze without flinching. You've faced enough drama—real and fictional—to know when someone is testing you. You hold your ground.

**The Director's** smile shifts. Something like respect, or at least reassessment.

**The Director:** "Interesting. You don't perform uncertainty. Either you're more confident than you should be, or you understand that here, presentation is everything." They gesture toward a seat near their platform. "Sit. I think we should talk properly."

**Failure:** The Director's gaze is heavy, and despite yourself, you look away first. Just for a moment—but a moment is enough.

**The Director's** smile sharpens.

**The Director:** "Ah. Still learning. That's not necessarily a weakness—humility has its uses. But this isn't the place to be humble." They wave a dismissive hand. "Explore. Learn the room. We'll speak again when you've... found your footing."

The audience is over. You've been dismissed.
