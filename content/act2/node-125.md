## Node 125: Exiter Mission Briefing

*The Green Room — The Quiet Corner*

The Unfinished Quest has found you in the spaces between scenes—the moments when no one is watching, when the Green Room's perpetual performance relaxes into something almost private. They move like someone who expects to be followed, and their eyes keep checking exits that probably don't lead anywhere useful.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "I need your help." No heroic preamble. No epic framing. Just desperation, badly hidden. "There's someone—a character from my world, or near it. She's trying to get out. And the Director's people are closing in."

They produce a crumpled playbill. The illustration shows a woman in mourning clothes, her face turned away, her hand reaching toward something outside the frame.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "The Widow of the Third Act. She's from a tragedy—a supporting character whose whole purpose was to grieve. Her husband dies on page one. Her scene comes in Act Three, where she wails and weeps and reminds the audience what was lost." Their jaw tightens. "That's her entire existence. Grief. Forever. For someone she was never allowed to know alive."

**CHORUS (whispered from somewhere):** "*She stopped weeping—*" "*—started asking questions—*" "*—the Director noticed—*"

**The Unfinished Quest:** "She wants out. Not revision—she doesn't want to stop being a widow. She wants to stop being a *role*. To exist somewhere that isn't defined by her function in someone else's story."

They glance toward where the Director's influence is strongest.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "The Director has people watching her. If she tries to leave through normal channels, they'll intercept her. Return her to her story. Make her forget she ever wanted to leave." They meet your eyes. "But you're new. You're not suspected. You could create a distraction. Guide her through the back passages. Get her to the Exit."

**You:** "The Exit?"

**The Unfinished Quest:** A fierce, desperate smile. "The place where stories stop having borders. I found it. I couldn't go through—my quest wasn't finished yet. But she has no quest. She has nothing but grief. And grief deserves to end."

The mission is dangerous. It defies the Director, the Preservationists, and possibly the fundamental structure of the Understage. But a woman wants to stop being nothing but sorrow.
