## Node 220: The Author's Desk

*The Archives — The Author's Desk*

You've passed the Critic. You've gathered the clues. And now, at the heart of the Archives, you find it.

The Author's Desk.

It's not what you expected. You imagined something grand—a throne of manuscripts, perhaps, or a towering bureau carved from the spines of forgotten books. Instead, it's almost ordinary. A simple wooden desk, scarred and ink-stained, with a single lamp casting warm light across its surface.

But the papers.

The papers are everywhere.

They cover the desk, spill onto the floor, climb the walls in pinned layers. Drafts upon drafts upon drafts. You see fragments of stories you recognize—the Pawn's prophecy, CHORUS's missing member, the Understudy's original. And stories you don't recognize, stories that haven't happened yet, stories that are still being written.

In the center of the desk sits a manuscript. The pages are crisp, the ink fresh. The title page reads:

**THE FINAL DRAFT**
*A Story to End All Stories*

The Understudy moves past you, drawn to the desk like a moth to flame. They pick up a loose page, read it, and their face goes pale.

**The Understudy:** "This is... this is everyone. Every character. Every story. It's all here—being rewritten. Being *edited* toward something."

You look closer. The manuscript isn't just a story. It's a *plan*. Annotations fill the margins: *consolidate*, *streamline*, *remove redundancy*. Arrows connect plot threads. Character names are crossed out, replaced, crossed out again.

Someone is editing the Understage itself.

**The Understudy:** "The Editor. They've been here. They're still *working*."

A pen lies beside the manuscript. Red ink. The nib is still wet.

You pick up the pen. It feels heavier than it should—heavier than any ordinary writing instrument. This is the tool that rewrites reality. This is what the Editor uses to change stories.

And here, in this pen's marks, you see the truth.

But the truth looks different depending on how you've learned to read.

**Flags Set:** `AUTHOR_DESK_REACHED`, `EDITOR_EVIDENCE_FOUND`

The evidence before you can be interpreted many ways. Your experiences in the Understage—the faction whose perspective you've come to understand—shapes what you see in these pages.

---

**Choices:**

1. *[Requires: `PRESERVATIONIST_ALIGNED` or highest faction is Preservationist]* Read the evidence through a Preservationist lens—the Editor fears stories are dying → Node 221
2. *[Requires: `REVISIONIST_ALIGNED` or highest faction is Revisionist]* Read the evidence through a Revisionist lens—the Editor was once like you → Node 222
3. *[Requires: `EXITER_ALIGNED` or highest faction is Exiter]* Read the evidence through an Exiter lens—the Editor wants freedom at any cost → Node 223
4. *[Requires: No clear faction alignment or deliberately Independent]* Read the evidence with fresh eyes—see what others might miss → Node 224

**Notes:**
- This node serves as the climax entry point, branching to four faction-specific revelation paths
- The player's faction alignment (tracked via flags) determines which interpretation path they take
- If a player has no clear alignment, they default to the Independent path (224)
- The red pen and wet ink emphasize that the Editor was recently here—tension and urgency
- The "Final Draft" manuscript title foreshadows the stakes of Act 3
- All paths lead to Node 225 (Revelation Response) after the faction-specific revelation
