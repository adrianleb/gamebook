## Node 128: Exiter Resolution

*The Green Room — After the Exit*

The space where the Widow used to stand thrums with residual energy—the narrative universe adjusting to her absence. Somewhere, in a tragedy you'll never read, a Third Act is now incomplete. A grief scene won't be performed. A husband's death will go unmourned by the character written to mourn it.

The story will adapt. Stories always do.

The Unfinished Quest finds you standing at the threshold, staring at the Exit that you helped someone use. Their expression is reverent.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "You did it." Their voice cracks with something that might be joy or might be grief. "She's free. Wherever she is—whatever she's becoming—she's no longer just a role."

They place a hand on your shoulder, and for the first time since you met them, they seem at peace.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "I couldn't do it. My quest wouldn't let me—there was always one more battle, one more duty, one more 'the fate of the world depends on you.' But you..." They meet your eyes. "You can move between. You're not bound by the narratives you touch. That makes you exactly what we need."

From their belt, they produce a compass—old, battered, its needle pointing toward nothing visible.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "The Exiter's Compass. It doesn't point north. It points *out*—toward whatever exit is nearest, in any story you find yourself in." They press it into your hands. "You've proven that escape is possible. That characters don't have to be prisoners of their functions. Keep proving it."

They glance toward where the Director holds court, and their expression hardens.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "The Director will notice what you did. Probably already has. But they won't act openly—not yet. You're too valuable to the other factions, too visible. Just..." A warning look. "Be careful. The ones who help characters escape are never forgiven. Not completely."

The mission is complete. The Exiter path has deepened, and the Archives await. But you've made an enemy of the Green Room's authority.
