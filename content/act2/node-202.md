## Node 202: The Prop Room

*The Archives — The Prop Room*

The Prop Room is chaos given purpose.

Objects pile in theatrical disorder—crowns tangled with puppet strings, swords balanced on stacks of unopened letters, masks watching from every surface. The room stretches larger than it should, alcoves branching into alcoves, each stuffed with the detritus of a thousand unfinished stories. Some items glow faintly with the residue of narrative power. Others seem to drain the light around them, creating pockets of darkness that feel deliberate.

You step carefully. Every prop here carries meaning. Every object was important to someone, somewhere, in some story that never quite happened.

A crown catches your attention—silver, tarnished, set with stones that might be gems or might be frozen tears. Beside it, a key ring holds keys of every size and material: brass, bone, shadow, light. A sword lies across a velvet-covered table, its blade etched with words that shift when you try to read them. A mirror leans against the far wall, reflecting a version of the room that's subtly *wrong*—the objects in different positions, the light coming from a different direction.

The Understudy follows you into the room, their eyes scanning the shelves with academic interest.

**The Understudy:** "Careful what you touch. These aren't just props—they're narrative weight. Pick up a sword, and you might inherit a war. Take a crown, and suddenly you have responsibilities you didn't ask for." They pause, running a finger along a dusty shelf. "But some of them are useful. Essential, even. The trick is knowing which is which."

They gesture toward the most promising items.

**The Understudy:** "If you're going to take something, take something that helps. I can try to assess the options, but ultimately..." They shrug. "You have to trust your instincts."

**[STAT CHECK: Script 2]**

Examine the props. Read their histories. Determine which carry benefits and which carry curses.

**Success:** Your eye for narrative structure serves you well. You can see the difference between props that will help and props that will harm. The sword with the shifting words is a trap—pick it up and you're obligated to a duel you can't win. The crown is genuine power but genuine responsibility. The keys... the keys are *interesting*. One of them opens doors that don't exist yet. Another locks away memories you'd rather keep.

But there—half-hidden beneath a pile of theatrical masks—you spot something truly useful: a First Draft Fragment. A piece of original manuscript, its pages still carrying the weight of an author's first intention. In the Archives, intention matters. This fragment could reveal truths that later revisions tried to hide.

**Failure:** Everything looks equally important. The sword calls to you, promising strength. The crown whispers of authority. The keys jingle with possibility. It's impossible to distinguish the useful from the dangerous—they all carry weight, and your instincts aren't refined enough to sort truth from temptation.

You reach for what seems most appealing...

**The Understudy:** "Wait." They catch your hand, their grip surprisingly firm. "That one's... I recognize that marking. It's from a tragedy. A specific kind of tragedy." They lower their voice. "The kind where the protagonist doesn't realize they're doomed until it's too late."

They redirect your attention to a safer section—less immediately impressive, but at least you won't inherit a curse.

**Notes:**
- The Script check determines whether the player can identify safe vs. dangerous props.
- Both outcomes lead to Node 205, but with different starting positions for the choice.
- Items acquired here will affect later Archives exploration.
