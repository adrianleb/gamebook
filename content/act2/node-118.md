## Node 118: Independent Revelation

*The Green Room — The Final Girl's Corner*

The Final Girl has found herself a corner that other characters avoid—too close to the fire exit that leads nowhere, too far from the main gathering areas. She's made it comfortable in a utilitarian way: clear sightlines, multiple escape routes, nothing that could hide a threat.

She looks up as you approach, and something in your expression makes her set down the knife she was sharpening. Not a weapon, she'd say—a tool. But the way she handles it tells a different story.

**The Final Girl:** "You've been making the rounds. I've been watching." She gestures for you to sit—on a crate that gives you your own view of the room. "Director's mission. CHORUS's whispers. The Unfinished Quest's dramatic speeches." A slight smile. "You haven't committed to any of them."

She knows. Somehow, she knows you've been keeping your options open, refusing to fall completely into any faction's orbit.

**The Final Girl:** "Smart. Or stupid. Depends on whether you know *why* you're doing it."

This is a different kind of test. Not presence, not script—pure improvisation. Can you explain your independence without sounding uncommitted?

**[APPROACH CHECK: Improv 3 OR Script 3]**

**Success:** You explain what you've observed: the way each faction sees only part of the truth. The Preservationists protect a system that traps. The Revisionists edit without asking consent. The Exiters free without considering consequences. None of them are wrong, exactly. But none of them are *right* enough.

**The Final Girl:** Something shifts in her expression—respect, maybe, or recognition. "You figured it out. Took me three sequels."

She leans forward, voice dropping.

**The Final Girl:** "The Director isn't neutral. No one in power ever is. They're Preservationist to the core, but they've learned to perform impartiality. Everyone who comes through here eventually aligns with someone—and the Director *always* knows which way they'll lean. Except..."

She studies you.

**The Final Girl:** "Except the ones who don't lean. The independents. We're the ones they can't predict. And that makes us *useful*." She pauses. "Or dangerous. Depending on who's asking."

She reaches into her jacket and pulls out something small—a blank card, pure white, with no markings.

**The Final Girl:** "The Independent's Blank. Take it. Flash it to any faction, and they'll think you're on their side. Once per hub. After that, they'll know what you are." She presses it into your hand. "What you are is someone who might actually see the whole picture. Don't waste it."

**Failure:** You try to explain your position, but it comes out sounding like indecision rather than intention. The Final Girl's expression doesn't change, but something closes behind her eyes.

**The Final Girl:** "You're not independent. You're just... undecided." She returns to her knife. "Figure out whether you're playing all sides or playing no sides. There's a difference. Come back when you know which."

The conversation is over, but not the opportunity. You've learned something about her perspective, even if you haven't earned her trust.
