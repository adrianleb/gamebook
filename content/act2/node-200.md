## Node 200: Archives Entry

*The Archives — Entry Hall*

The Archives reveal themselves in impossible increments.

You step through the threshold and space unfolds wrong. The corridor behind you—whichever corridor you took—stretches backward into darkness that feels longer than the distance you walked. Ahead, the entry hall expands in directions that shouldn't exist: shelves spiral upward into shadows that aren't quite shadows, aisles branch at angles that make your eyes water, and somewhere far above, a ceiling that might be clouds or might be pages drifts in patterns that suggest weather.

The air smells of paper, dust, and something like lightning. Words whisper at the edge of hearing—not voices, but text reading itself aloud in the spaces between thought.

The Understudy stands beside you, their breath quickening as they take in the vastness. Whether you came here as partners or arrived through official channels, they're here now—drawn by whatever research has consumed them. Their hands move to the satchel at their side, touching the outline of the annotated manuscript within.

**The Understudy:** "I've read about this place. Studied the maps. But the maps..." They trail off, gesturing at a staircase that descends *upward* toward a balcony somehow below you. "The maps lie. They have to. How do you chart something that refuses to hold still?"

CHORUS echoes somewhere in the stacks, their overlapping voices distant and fragmentary: "—the new Prompter, yes, the new—" "—the Understudy brought one, finally—" "—we remember when the Editor used to—" The voices cut off abruptly, as if someone pressed a hand over a collective mouth.

At the far end of the entry hall, you glimpse movement. Something watching from behind a shelf. The shape is there and then gone, leaving only the impression of severity—of judgment waiting to be rendered. The Critic, perhaps. The stories about them weren't exaggerated.

Three areas are immediately accessible from the entry hall:

The **Stacks** dominate the left passage—endless shelves of unwritten pages, abandoned drafts, and stories that never quite became. They call to something in you, promising knowledge if you're willing to get lost finding it.

The **Prop Room** occupies a wide archway to the right. Through it, you see objects piled in theatrical disarray: swords and crowns and keys and things less nameable. Some glow faintly. Others seem to absorb light. All of them carry weight—narrative weight.

And directly ahead, past the entry hall's central fountain (which flows with ink, not water), the **deeper Archives** await. But you're not ready for those depths. Not yet.

The Understudy clears their throat, pulling your attention back.

**The Understudy:** "I... I know what I need to find. Or at least where to start looking. But we should explore first. Get our bearings." They gesture toward the branching paths. "And we should probably talk about what we're really doing here. What I'm asking you to help me with."

Their voice carries a vulnerability that wasn't there in the Green Room. Here, in this place of unwritten truths, their carefully maintained composure is beginning to crack.
