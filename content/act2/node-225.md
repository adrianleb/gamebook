## Node 225: Revelation Response

*The Archives — The Author's Desk*

You know the truth now. Or at least, a version of it—filtered through your faction's lens, shaped by the stories you've told yourself about what matters. The Editor's work lies before you: the Final Draft, incomplete but growing. Each word written brings the Understage closer to its conclusion.

The Understudy stands beside you, still processing what you've discovered. Their usual nervous energy has stilled into something quieter. More focused.

**The Understudy:** "So what happens now? We know what they're doing. We know *why*. But knowing isn't stopping."

They're right. The Editor is still out there, still writing. The Final Draft grows with every moment you spend deliberating. But rushing forward blindly seems just as dangerous as doing nothing.

You look at the evidence spread across the desk. The drafts. The notes. The fragments of stories that have already been... edited.

**The Understudy:** "We could go back. Tell the others—the Director, the factions, anyone who'll listen. Build something together. Strength in numbers."

They pause, glancing toward the darker corners of the Archives.

**The Understudy:** "Or we could keep looking. There's more here—I can feel it. The Editor's identity. Their weaknesses. Information is power, right?"

Their voice drops lower.

**The Understudy:** "We could also... act. Directly. The Editor's work isn't finished yet. Maybe we can stop it before it's too late. Disrupt. Delay. *Something*."

Finally, they look at you with something like hope.

**The Understudy:** "Or we warn everyone. Not just our faction—*everyone*. The whole Understage. If enough stories stand together, maybe the Editor can't write over all of us."

Four paths. Four ways to respond to the truth.

### Your Allies

*Your current allies will affect your options in Act 3:*

*If you have `FACTION_PRESERVATIONIST`, `FACTION_REVISIONIST`, or `FACTION_EXITER`:*
Your faction will support whatever you decide—but returning to them now would cement your role as their champion.

*If you have `FACTION_INDEPENDENT`:*
You've maintained your independence. You can approach any faction, but none will follow you without question.

*If you have `UNDERSTUDY_BOND`:*
The Understudy will follow you anywhere. Their loyalty is personal now, not political.

*If you have `EXTERNAL_THREAT_KNOWN`:*
You understand the Blank Page threat. This knowledge makes coalition-building more persuasive.

*If you have `EDITOR_ALLY_POSSIBLE`:*
You saw something in the Editor's work that suggests they might be reasoned with. Confrontation might not mean conflict.

**What do you do with the truth?**

---

**Choices:**

1. Return to your faction with this knowledge. Rally them for the coming confrontation. → Node 226 (Faction Rally)
   - *Recommended if you have strong faction alignment*

2. Search for more information before acting. The Editor's full identity might be here somewhere. → Node 227 (Deeper Investigation)
   - *Requires patience and research skills*

3. Act now. Disrupt the Editor's work directly before it's too late. → Node 228 (Direct Confrontation)
   - *Dangerous but potentially decisive*

4. Warn everyone—all factions, all stories. Build a coalition against the common threat. → Node 229 (Warning Others)
   - *Requires persuasion and improvisation*

**Flags Set:** `REVELATION_RESPONSE_REACHED`

**Notes:**
- This is the Act 2 climax choice point—the player's decision shapes Act 3's opening conditions
- All four paths converge at Node 230 (Act 2 Conclusion) with different flags and consequences
- The ally summary reminds players of their accumulated relationships
- The Understudy serves as the voice presenting options without judgment
- Each path has different stat requirements and risk/reward profiles
- No path is "correct"—all lead to viable Act 3 openings with different advantages

**Design Intent:**
- Present meaningful choice with clear stakes and trade-offs
- Reward accumulated flags by showing how they affect options
- The Understudy's voice keeps the moment grounded and human
- Four distinct approaches: political (rally), intellectual (investigate), bold (confront), social (warn)
