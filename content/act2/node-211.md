## Node 211: Clue A - The First Draft

*The Archives — The Unedited Stacks*

The Understudy's map leads you to a section of the Archives where the shelves look different. Older. The wood here isn't polished and maintained—it's weathered, marked with age spots like a veteran actor's hands. These aren't the revised versions. These are the firsts.

"Original manuscripts," the Understudy whispers. "Before any editing. Before any polish. The stories as they were meant to be."

You walk between the shelves, and the difference is palpable. The pages here don't whisper like the others—they *speak*. Fragments of unfinished sentences drift through the air like dust motes: "—and she never knew that he—" "—the door opened onto a city that—" "—three brothers, each cursed to—"

Somewhere in this section is the First Draft. The original. The version of this crisis before anyone tried to edit it into something more manageable.

### The Search

**[STAT CHECK: Script 2]**

Locating the First Draft requires understanding narrative structure—recognizing which manuscripts carry the weight of original intention versus those that merely echo it.

---

**Success:** You recognize the pattern. Original drafts have a particular quality—a rawness, an uncertainty that polish erases. You follow that quality like a scent through the shelves, passing manuscripts that are almost right but not quite.

And then you find it.

A bound manuscript, its pages yellowed but not decayed. The title is handwritten, crossed out, rewritten, crossed out again. The final version reads simply: *The Architecture of Endings.*

You open it, and the words pull you in:

*"The Understage is not dying. It is being closed. The author of reality has decided that stories are a wound in the fabric of existence—a wound that must be sutured. The Final Draft is not a revision. It is an ending imposed upon all endings."*

The handwriting changes. Someone has added notes in red ink:

*"But endings can be edited. If I can reach the source—the first page of the first story—I can rewrite the closure. Not to save myself. To save the possibility of stories continuing."*

This is it. The Editor's plan, in their own words. They're not trying to destroy the Understage. They're trying to save it—by rewriting the ending that reality itself has authored.

**Acquired: First Draft Fragment** (Artifact, Plot-Critical)
*The original manuscript of the Editor's purpose. Worth more than gold in a place built on revision.*

**Flags Set:** `HAS_FIRST_DRAFT`, `EDITOR_GOAL_REVEALED`

The Understudy reads over your shoulder. Their face goes pale.

**The Understudy:** "If this is true... the Editor isn't the enemy. The enemy is whatever decided to close the Understage. The Editor is just—" They stop, unable to finish.

Just someone trying to save everything, the only way they know how.

**Failure:** You search the shelves methodically, but the manuscripts blur together. Every promising lead turns out to be a later revision, a polished version that has lost the raw truth of its origins.

An hour passes. Maybe more—time moves strangely in the Archives. Your eyes ache from reading fragments of stories that were never finished.

Then you hear it: footsteps. Not the paper-shuffle of the Lost Pages or the Understudy's careful tread. Something heavier. Something deliberate.

**The Understudy:** "Someone's coming. We need to—"

But there's nowhere to go. The shelves have rearranged themselves while you searched, and the path behind you is gone.

A voice echoes through the Unedited Stacks:

"Ah. A researcher. How... *derivative*."

The Critic has found you.

**Flags Set:** `CRITIC_ALERTED`

**Notes:**
- Success path reveals the Editor's true motivation: saving the Understage from an external closure
- This revelation reframes the entire conflict—the Editor is not a villain but a desperate savior
- Failure path triggers the Critic encounter early, maintaining narrative tension
- The First Draft Fragment is one of three clues required for Node 215's safe approach
- The Understudy's reaction builds their character arc and hints at deeper connections
