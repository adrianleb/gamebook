## Node 222: Revisionist Revelation

*The Archives — The Author's Desk*

You've walked with the Revisionists. You understand the hunger to rewrite, to fix, to make stories better than they were. And so when you look at the Editor's work, you recognize something familiar.

Too familiar.

Buried beneath the clinical annotations, you find older pages. Drafts from before the Final Draft. And in those earlier pages, you see handwriting you almost recognize.

*We can fix them*, these older notes read. *Every story has potential. Every character deserves a better arc. We just need to show them what they could become.*

The optimism in those words is almost painful to read. Because you've seen what came after.

The Understudy finds a fragment you missed—a page torn and re-taped, as if the Editor tried to destroy it and then couldn't bear to.

**The Understudy:** "This is... look at this. These are personal notes. From when they first started."

You read. And the truth emerges like a wound reopening.

The Editor was a Revisionist once. Perhaps the first Revisionist, or the most devoted. They believed in the power of rewriting to heal. They edited a story—maybe many stories—and at first, it worked. The stories improved. The characters flourished.

But then something went wrong.

### Recognizing the Editor's Past

**[STAT CHECK: Stage Presence 3]**

To understand the Editor's journey requires seeing past the clinical distance to the person beneath. It takes the emotional intelligence to recognize yourself in someone else's mistakes.

---

**Success:** You find the page that changes everything.

It's a revision. Crossed out, rewritten, crossed out again. The same scene, over and over, each version slightly different. And in the margins, increasingly desperate annotations:

*Why won't it work?*
*Every change makes it worse.*
*I fixed them and they're still dying.*

The Editor revised too much. They edited something essential away—the imperfections that made the characters feel real, the inconsistencies that made the stories breathe. They tried to perfect stories, and in doing so, they destroyed what made them worth telling.

And then they kept going. Because stopping would mean admitting what they'd done.

**The Understudy:** "They were like you. Like the Revisionists. They believed they could make everything better." Their voice catches. "And when they realized they'd made it worse... they couldn't stop. Stopping would mean facing what they'd broken."

The Final Draft isn't a new plan. It's an attempt to undo decades of mistakes. The Editor is trying to rewrite their own edits, to restore what they destroyed—but they're using the same methods that broke everything in the first place.

They can't stop editing. It's all they know how to do.

**Flags Set:** `REVELATION_REVISIONIST`, `EDITOR_ORIGIN_KNOWN`

**Choices:**

1. Proceed to respond to this revelation → Node 225

**Failure:** The older pages are fragmentary, damaged, hard to parse. You catch glimpses—the Editor was once different, once hopeful, once believed in the power of revision to heal rather than harm.

Something happened to change them. Something they caused.

**The Understudy:** "They broke something. Something important. And now they're trying to fix it the only way they know how—by editing more."

It's not the full picture, but the shape is clear enough. The Editor is caught in a cycle of their own making, revising and re-revising, unable to stop.

**Flags Set:** `REVELATION_REVISIONIST`

**Consequences:** Without understanding the specific origin of the Editor's trauma, confronting them will be more difficult in Act 3.

**Choices:**

1. Proceed to respond to this revelation → Node 225

**Notes:**
- The Revisionist revelation frames the Editor as a cautionary tale—revision gone too far
- This path creates the most personal connection for Revisionist-aligned players
- The "can't stop editing" theme mirrors addiction and compulsion
- Success reveals the Editor's specific trauma, providing leverage in Act 3
- The Understudy's emotional reaction ("they were like you") creates player introspection
- Both paths lead to Node 225, with different flags affecting Act 3 confrontation options
