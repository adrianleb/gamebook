## Node 206: Joint Investigation

*The Archives — Research Alcove*

The Understudy leads you deeper into the Archives, past the main stacks and into a section where the shelves lean toward each other like conspirators sharing secrets. The impossible geometry intensifies here—you pass the same alcove twice from different directions before the Understudy finds what they're looking for.

**The Understudy:** "Here. I've been gathering research in this corner. The Archives don't seem to notice it, or maybe they approve." They pull aside a curtain of dust motes that hang motionless in the air, revealing a workspace cluttered with manuscripts, margin notes, and pages covered in cramped annotations.

You settle in beside them, examining the evidence they've accumulated. Together, the pattern becomes clearer than either of you could see alone.

The disturbances in the Archives aren't random. They follow a progression: first, small changes—a word altered here, a name replaced there. Then larger revisions—entire scenes rewritten, characters excised from their narratives. And finally, for some stories, complete erasure. The pages simply stop existing.

**The Understudy:** "I've been tracking the timeline. Watch." They spread pages across the workspace, arranging them by date. "The small changes started months ago. The erasures began three weeks ago. And this—" They tap a manuscript fragment marked with red ink. "This is from yesterday. Someone is accelerating."

**[STAT CHECK: Script 3]**

Analyze the accumulated evidence with the Understudy. Look for the pattern beneath the pattern—not just what is being changed, but why.

**Success:** You recognize something the Understudy missed. The changes aren't just editing—they're *writing*. Each revision connects to others, building toward something. A story is being constructed from the fragments of other stories. Not revision for revision's sake, but creation through destruction.

More importantly, you notice a gap in the pattern. Certain stories are untouched—stories that share a specific characteristic. They all feature characters who made genuine choices within their narratives. Self-aware characters. Characters like... the Understudy.

**You:** "You're not in danger of being erased. You're a data point. Whoever's doing this—they're studying characters who gained awareness. They're trying to understand how it happened."

The Understudy's eyes widen. The fear doesn't leave their face, but it changes shape. They're not prey. They're evidence.

**The Understudy:** "Then we need to find the others like me. The Runaway. The Prophecy's Pawn. The self-aware characters from other stories." They pause, something shifting in their expression. "And I need to tell you something. About why I think I know so much about this pattern."

**Flags Set:** `INVESTIGATION_BREAKTHROUGH`, `EDITOR_PATTERN_UNDERSTOOD`

→ Go to Node 207 (Understudy's Confession)

**Failure:** The pattern eludes you. The evidence is there, but the connections between revision events remain frustratingly unclear. You're missing something—some key that would unlock the meaning.

**You:** "I can see something is happening, but I can't tell *why*. What's the Editor trying to accomplish?"

**The Understudy:** "I don't know either. That's the terrible part." They gather the papers, frustrated. "I've been at this for weeks. Every time I think I understand, another piece of evidence contradicts my theory."

They stand, pacing the small space between shelves.

**The Understudy:** "Maybe we're looking at this wrong. Maybe we need more eyes on the problem. There are others who might help—if we can find them."

**Flags Set:** `INVESTIGATION_STALLED`

**Notes:**
- This node establishes the joint investigation mechanic and deepens the partnership with the Understudy.
- Success leads to the emotional revelation in Node 207, creating narrative momentum.
- Failure redirects to the investigation hub (Node 210), maintaining progression while leaving questions unanswered.
- The breakthrough discovery about self-aware characters connects to the broader theme of narrative agency.
