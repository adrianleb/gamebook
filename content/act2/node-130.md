## Node 130: Archives Approach

*The Green Room — The Back Passages*

You've navigated the Green Room's politics, completed your work among the faction representatives, and now there's only one direction left: deeper. The Archives await—that vast repository of unwritten stories, abandoned drafts, and dangerous knowledge that every faction mentioned in whispers.

The question is how you get there.

The Green Room's back passages converge at an unmarked junction. Three corridors branch from this point, each leading toward the Archives through different means. The air here tastes older, like pages left too long in sealed rooms. The lighting flickers between scenes—now candlelight, now fluorescent, now something that might be moonlight filtered through stained glass.

CHORUS drifts past, their voices overlapping in fragments: "—the Director's way is watched—" "—we know passages they've forgotten—" "—the Understudy waits by the third door—"

You catalog your options:

The first corridor is formal, marked with the Director's seal. Anyone who's earned Preservationist favor—or impressed the Director directly—can walk this path openly. The cost is visibility; the Director's observers will track your movements through the Archives.

The second corridor is unmarked, half-hidden behind a prop curtain that doesn't quite hang right. CHORUS knows this route—they've mapped the Green Room's forgotten spaces over centuries of collective observation. Less official, but less watched.

The third corridor is simply... occupied. The Understudy stands at its entrance, watching you with an intensity that suggests they've been waiting. They look exhausted—dark circles under their eyes, a nervous energy in their movements—but their posture straightens when you approach. They need something. And they're willing to offer something in return.
