## Node 119: Preservationist Resolution

*The Green Room — The Prepared Story*

The story they've chosen is beautiful in its simplicity: "The Boy Who Came Home." A children's adventure where a lost child is found by a family who was always meant to find him. The pages glow with the warm certainty of resolution—a narrative designed to heal.

The Bleeding Fragment stands at the threshold, your hand on his shoulder. He's stopped shifting; in the presence of a story that *wants* him, his features have begun to stabilize. Not the face his author would have given him, exactly, but a face. His own.

**The Director:** "You've done excellent work, Prompter." They stand at a respectful distance, the Solved Case beside them. "The contamination will end. The Green Room will stabilize. And the child..."

They gesture toward the story's glow.

**The Director:** "The child will have what everyone deserves. A proper ending."

**Bleeding Fragment:** He turns to look at you, and his eyes—finally settled on a warm brown—are complicated. "You listened to me. Even when you didn't have to." He squeezes your hand. "I'm going to be okay. I think. At least... at least it's an ending I understand."

He steps forward, and the story receives him. For a moment, you see him sketched into the narrative—running through illustrated woods, being caught in loving illustrated arms. Then the pages close, and the warmth fades, and the story is complete.

**The Solved Case:** "Clean work." They offer their hand—a genuine handshake this time. "The partner arrangement stands. When you're ready to dig into the Archives, I'll be there."

The Director produces something from their coat—an ornate seal pressed in gold wax.

**The Director:** "The Director's Sigil. It opens doors that prefer to remain closed. Consider it a reward for service well rendered."

They pause, and something flickers behind their composed expression—the barest hint of genuine emotion.

**The Director:** "You've proven that some stories need to end the way they were written. Not every problem requires reinvention. Remember that, when the revisionists whisper their alternatives."

The mission is complete. The Preservationist path has deepened, and the Archives await.
