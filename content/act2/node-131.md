## Node 131: Official Access

*The Green Room — The Formal Passage*

The Director's corridor is everything you'd expect from an official route: well-lit, clearly marked, and thoroughly observed. Portraits line the walls—not of people, but of stories. Covers of books that were written correctly, produced properly, and ended as intended. The Preservationist hall of fame.

Halfway down, a checkpoint. Two figures in usher's uniforms—characters from crowd scenes, perhaps, or extras given purpose—examine your credentials. The Director's Sigil gleams in your pocket, or perhaps it's simply the weight of Preservationist favor that opens the way.

**Usher:** "The Archives are open to you, Prompter." Their voice is polite, rehearsed. "The Director asks only that you remember: some sections are restricted for reasons. The deep stacks hold stories that wanted too much. The Prop Room contains objects with... difficult histories. And the Author's Desk is not for casual visitors."

They hand you a small card—a map, of sorts, though the lines shift when you're not looking directly at them.

**Usher:** "Stay on the approved paths. Report any... irregularities... to the nearest observer." A pause. "The Director wishes you productive research."

The formality is oppressive but not unkind. You're trusted, within limits. The Archives open before you—vast, ancient, and extensively cataloged.

You notice, as you enter, that you're not alone. Other researchers move through the stacks, each wearing some variation of the Preservationist insignia. Some nod in recognition. Some watch with the careful assessment of colleagues who haven't yet decided if you're a peer or a rival.

The Director's favor has opened doors. But those doors have frames, and the frames have eyes.
