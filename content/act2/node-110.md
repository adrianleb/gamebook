## Node 110: CHORUS Rumor Hook

*The Green Room — The Margins*

CHORUS flows around you, their collective attention focused in a way that feels almost physical. Faces cycle through the crowd of minor characters: the bartender who served the hero, the bystander who witnessed the crime, the soldier who fell in the background of the battle scene. All of them watching. All of them remembering.

**CHORUS:** "You want to know more. We can feel it—the wanting. You're not content with the surface. You want to know what moves beneath." Their voices layer and harmonize. "We respect that. We are the ones who see what protagonists miss."

They drift closer, their collective form becoming more cohesive—as if the rumors they're about to share require more focus than usual.

**CHORUS:** "There is a presence in the Archives. Not the Critic—they're old news, old threat. Something new. Something that writes in red ink." Multiple faces look at you simultaneously. "Do you know what red ink means, little Prompter? In our world, in the margins of stories, red ink is the color of permanent change. Edits that can't be undone."

They swirl, agitated now.

**CHORUS:** "We've lost members. Pages of us—the minor scenes, the background moments—going missing. Edited out. And no one remembers them but us." A sound like wind through empty theaters. "Someone is rewriting things. Someone with the power to change what was written and make it so it was never written at all."

A face pushes to the front—older than the others, wearier.

**CHORUS:** "The Director pretends they don't know. Maybe they don't. Maybe they do and they're scared. But we know. We are the margins, and the margins are where the editing happens first."

They want to show you more. But to see it, you need to demonstrate that you can hold their attention—that you're worth the risk of sharing deeper secrets.

**[STAT CHECK: Stage Presence 2]**

**Success:** You project certainty. Not arrogance—presence. The kind of energy that makes crowds part and minor characters step aside. CHORUS responds to it, their collective attention sharpening.

**CHORUS:** "Yes. You have the weight of story on you. You could be a protagonist if you chose—but you're choosing something else. We like that." They part, creating a path through their collective form. "Come with us. We'll show you what we've found."

They begin to move toward a corner of the Green Room you hadn't noticed before—a space that seems to fold in on itself.

**CHORUS:** "The Editor—we've heard the name whispered. Never seen, never confirmed. But the evidence is there for those who know how to look." Their voice drops to a whisper of whispers. "The Call Board. The red ink notice. Have you seen it? 'Casting call: The Final Draft.' No one knows what it means. But we think... we think it's a warning. Or an invitation. Or both."

**Failure:** You try to hold their attention, but CHORUS is slippery—they flow around your presence like water around a stone. You're too singular, too focused. They need someone who can think in fragments.

**CHORUS:** "Not yet. You're still too... whole." Their voices fade as they begin to disperse. "The information is there. The warnings are everywhere. But you're looking with protagonist eyes. Look with ours—with the eyes of those who watch from the margins—and you'll see."

They scatter back into the background, becoming once again the forgettable faces of a thousand unnamed roles.
