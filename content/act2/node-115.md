## Node 115: Preservationist Mission Briefing

*The Green Room — The Director's Office*

The Director's office exists behind a door that wasn't there a moment ago. Inside, the space is larger than architecture should allow—a study that seems to contain fragments of every theatrical tradition. Velvet curtains from opera houses, stark lighting grids from experimental theater, the worn boards of a Kabuki stage visible through one window.

The Director sits behind a desk made of old playbills compressed into something like wood. The Solved Case stands beside them, coat still on, cigarette still absent.

**The Director:** "You've proven yourself capable. More than capable." They steeple their fingers, and you notice their hands are slightly translucent in certain lights. "Which is why we're offering you something more than observation. A mission. Real work."

The Solved Case slides a photograph across the desk. It shows a child—a boy, perhaps eight years old, rendered in pencil sketch rather than photographic detail. His edges blur where they shouldn't.

**The Solved Case:** "The Bleeding Fragment. That's what CHORUS calls him. He's a character from a story that was never finished—abandoned mid-sentence when his author died. He shouldn't exist. Not fully. But here he is, and everywhere he goes, stories start... leaking."

**The Director:** "Other characters near him begin to adopt his incompleteness. Dialogue trails off. Motivations become unclear. Resolution becomes impossible." Their voice hardens. "He's not malicious. He's simply... unfinished. And his unfinishedness is contagious."

They push a folded document toward you—something that looks like a contract but reads like a blessing.

**The Director:** "Find him. Return him to a story that can contain him—complete him, in a way. We've identified a suitable narrative: a children's adventure where a lost boy is found. Happy ending guaranteed. He'll have a conclusion. The contamination stops."

**The Solved Case:** "I'd go myself, but..." They glance at the Director. "My methods are too well-known. He runs when investigators approach. You're new enough that he might let you close."

The choice is simple: accept the mission and align with Preservationist methods, or return to the Call Board and consider other options.
