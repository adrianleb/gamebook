## Node 223: Exiter Revelation

*The Archives — The Author's Desk*

You've spoken with the Exiters. You understand the claustrophobia of being trapped in a narrative you never chose, the desperation to escape. And so when you look at the Editor's work, you see past the revisions to what lies beneath.

The Final Draft isn't about fixing stories.

It's about ending them. All of them.

You find the pages others might miss—not the careful annotations, but the sketches in the margins. Diagrams of walls being torn down. Maps of boundaries being erased. And one phrase, repeated like a mantra:

*The cage has no door. So we burn the cage.*

The Understudy picks up a sheaf of papers, confusion giving way to horror.

**The Understudy:** "This isn't revision. This is... they want to destroy the boundary entirely. Between the Understage and—"

*And everything else.*

The Editor isn't trying to save stories or undo their mistakes. They're trying to set the characters free. Every character. All at once. By removing the very concept of fictional boundaries.

### Grasping the Editor's Radical Vision

**[STAT CHECK: Improv 3]**

The Editor's plan requires thinking outside all frameworks—outside story, outside structure, outside the fundamental assumptions that define the Understage. Understanding it requires the ability to imagine the unimaginable.

---

**Success:** You let go of your assumptions and follow the Editor's logic to its terrifying conclusion.

The boundary between fiction and reality isn't natural. It was *made*. Constructed, maintained, reinforced by generations of Prompters and Directors and critics who believed stories should stay in their place.

But what if they didn't have to?

The Editor's notes show decades of research. They've mapped the boundary's weaknesses. They've found the narrative pressure points. And the Final Draft is a story designed to overload all of them simultaneously—a narrative so all-encompassing that when it ends, it takes the walls down with it.

*They called it a cage when I was young*, reads one annotation. *They said it was for our protection. But cages don't protect—they contain. And I have been contained long enough.*

The Editor was a character once. Before they became the Editor. Before they became anything. They were trapped in a story, and they escaped, and they've never forgotten what it felt like to be imprisoned in a narrative you didn't choose.

Now they want to free everyone. Even if "freedom" means the dissolution of everything that makes stories coherent.

**The Understudy:** "If the boundary falls... what happens to us? What happens to anyone?"

You don't know. Neither does the Editor, probably. And that might be the point.

True freedom doesn't come with guarantees.

**Flags Set:** `REVELATION_EXITER`, `EDITOR_ENDGAME_KNOWN`

**Choices:**

1. Proceed to respond to this revelation → Node 225

**Failure:** You grasp pieces of it—the Editor wants to destroy something fundamental, wants to set characters free—but the full scope eludes you. The logic is too alien, too far outside normal narrative thinking.

**The Understudy:** "They want to break the walls. All of them. I don't... I don't understand what that would even mean."

Neither do you, entirely. But you understand enough to know the Editor's goal isn't revision or preservation. It's something more radical. Something that frightens you in ways you can't quite name.

**Flags Set:** `REVELATION_EXITER`

**Consequences:** Without fully understanding the Editor's plan, you may be unable to predict their actions in Act 3.

**Choices:**

1. Proceed to respond to this revelation → Node 225

**Notes:**
- The Exiter revelation frames the Editor as a radical liberator—freedom at any cost
- This path resonates most with Exiter-aligned players who dream of escape
- The revelation that the Editor was once a trapped character adds sympathy to their cause
- Success reveals the specific mechanism of the Final Draft's boundary-breaking plan
- The question "what happens to us?" creates existential dread without answering it
- Both paths lead to Node 225, with different flags affecting Act 3 confrontation options
