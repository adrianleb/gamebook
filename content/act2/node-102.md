## Node 102: Main Lounge Exploration

*The Green Room — Main Lounge*

**[IF CROSSING_NEGOTIATED]:**
The Guide's voice echoes in your memory—a farewell whisper as they faded: *I've told them about you. The ones who matter. They won't welcome you, but they won't fear you either. That's the best I can offer.* As you step into the lounge, you sense the difference. Characters glance your way with curiosity instead of suspicion. Introductions have been made. Doors are already half-open.

**[IF CROSSING_DESPERATE]:**
Word has already spread. You can see it in the sidelong glances, the whispered conversations that stop when you approach. Someone who survived the desperate crossing. Someone unpredictable. In a place where everyone fits a role, you're the wild card—the plot twist that hasn't been written yet. Some characters shrink from that uncertainty. Others lean toward it, intrigued.

**[END IF]**

The Main Lounge stretches before you like a theatrical memory made physical. Every corner seems to belong to a different story—or perhaps every story has claimed its own corner. You move through the space, cataloging what you see.

Near the bar, a woman in a trench coat and shadows examines an empty glass as if it contains evidence. Her posture screams detective, private eye, someone who's solved too many cases. The Solved Case. The placard on her table reads: PRESERVATIONIST LIAISON. She notices you looking and raises her glass in a sardonic toast.

Across the room, a figure in battered armor sits motionless on a throne-like chair, staring at a sword laid across their knees. They look like they're waiting for something—a battle, a quest, a purpose. The Unfinished Quest. Their table reads: EXITER CONTACT. They don't acknowledge you at all.

In a dimly lit alcove, a woman watches the room with the practiced paranoia of someone who's survived things. The Final Girl. Her table has no placard. She catches your eye and holds it for exactly three seconds before looking away. A test, perhaps. Or a warning.

And near a window that somehow shows both sunset and rain, a figure whose beauty feels almost aggressive speaks earnestly to a cluster of listeners. The Happy Ending. Their table reads: REVISIONIST WELCOME. They gesture expansively as they talk, and their audience nods in rapt attention.

At the center of the lounge, a massive board dominates one wall. THE CALL BOARD, a banner proclaims. Notices cover every inch—job postings, warnings, requests for assistance. You can see faction symbols on some of them: gold for Preservationist, silver for Revisionist, copper for Exiter.

CHORUS drifts past you, their collective voice a murmur: *So many choices, little Prompter. Everyone wants something. The question is what you want.*

The Director watches from their platform. The Green Room waits for you to choose.
