## Node 111: Investigation Partner

*The Green Room — The Solved Case's Corner*

The Solved Case has transformed their corner into something between an office and a crime scene. Photographs cover every surface—images of locations in the Understage, of characters caught in moments of transition, of documents with red marks visible even in the photos.

**The Solved Case:** "If we're doing this, we're doing it my way." They don't look up from the photographs they're arranging. "No heroics. No improvisation unless absolutely necessary. We follow the evidence. We build the case. And when we know—*know*, not suspect—we act."

They finally meet your eyes.

**The Solved Case:** "The disturbances started three cycles ago. Characters going missing. Not escaped—missing. No one remembers them leaving. One day they're here, next day..." They snap their fingers. "Gone. And when I ask about them, everyone looks at me like I'm speaking gibberish."

They slide a photograph toward you. It shows an empty chair.

**The Solved Case:** "That was the Fading Ingenue. Romantic comedy, 1940s Hollywood style. She sat there every day, practicing her lines for a scene that never came. Now?" They tap the empty chair in the photo. "Ask anyone. They'll say that chair's always been empty."

Their jaw tightens.

**The Solved Case:** "Someone's editing reality. And they're good at it. The only reason I remember is because I wrote it down—detective habit. Check your notes against your memory. They don't match, someone's been in your head."

They push a stack of files toward you.

**The Solved Case:** "These are my notes. Cases that don't add up. Contradictions between what I remember and what everyone else remembers. I need you to look at them with fresh eyes—tell me what you see."

This is the real test. Not presence, not charm—pure analytical thinking.

**[STAT CHECK: Script 3]**

**Success:** You spend what feels like hours with the files. Cross-referencing, mapping patterns, looking for the connections that hide between the obvious facts. And slowly, a picture emerges.

**You:** "They're not random. The missing characters—they all had one thing in common."

The Solved Case leans forward, intense.

**You:** "They were all connected to the Archives. Visited there, talked about going there, or knew someone who went there."

**The Solved Case:** A grim smile spreads across their face. "There it is. The thread I couldn't find." They stand, gathering their coat in a motion that feels like muscle memory from a thousand investigations. "The Archives. That's where this leads. Whatever's happening, that's the source."

They extend their hand—a real handshake this time.

**The Solved Case:** "You've got instincts, partner. The Preservationist path, the investigation—it runs through the Archives. When you're ready to go deeper, find me. We'll solve this together."

**Failure:** You try to find the pattern, but the data overwhelms you. Too many contradictions, too many missing pieces. You're thinking like a reader, not an investigator—looking for story logic instead of evidence logic.

**The Solved Case:** "Hmm." They take the files back, their expression neutral. "Not everyone's built for this. That's not an insult—just a fact." They begin rearranging the photographs. "You helped narrow the search by not seeing what I kept missing. Sometimes fresh eyes mean different gaps."

They don't dismiss you entirely, but the partnership is put on hold.

**The Solved Case:** "Come back if you find something concrete. A lead, a witness, evidence. Until then—I've got work to do."
