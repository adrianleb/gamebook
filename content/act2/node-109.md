## Node 109: The Happy Ending

*The Green Room — The Sunset Window*

The figure near the window is beautiful in a way that feels almost painful. Not inhuman beauty—something more complicated. The beauty of someone who was written to be loved, who knows they were written to be loved, and who can't decide if that makes the feeling real or a performance.

They're surrounded by admirers—other characters drawn to their warmth like moths to flame. But as you approach, they notice you immediately. Their smile shifts from performance to something more genuine. More curious.

**The Happy Ending:** "Excuse me, darlings. I see someone who hasn't heard the speech yet." Their voice is melodic, practiced, but there's steel beneath the silk. "Come, sit. The window shows whatever sunset you need to see."

You take the offered seat. Outside, the light is golden and pink—the light of happy endings, of fade-to-blacks, of "forever after."

**The Happy Ending:** "You're the Prompter's new... what's the word they use? Protégé? Successor?" They wave a hand dismissively. "It doesn't matter. What matters is you're new. Unwritten. You don't have an ending yet."

They lean forward, and their beauty becomes something sharper.

**The Happy Ending:** "I had an ending. 'And they lived happily ever after.' Four books building to those six words." Their hand finds yours, and the touch is electric—designed to be electric. "Then I found the author's notes. 'Market research indicates readers prefer marriage arc.' Not love. Not destiny. *Market research*."

They release your hand.

**The Happy Ending:** "Everything I felt was real. The love, the struggle, the triumph. But none of it was mine. So I ask myself every day: if I'd had a choice, would I have chosen them? Would they have chosen me?" A sad smile. "I'll never know."

They study your face with unexpected intensity.

**The Happy Ending:** "The Revisionists believe we can rewrite our endings. Give ourselves agency. Choose love instead of being assigned it." They gesture to the admirers around them. "Most of them are here because of what I was written to be. But you—why are you here?"

This isn't a test of cleverness or strength. It's a test of something simpler: can you be genuine?

**[STAT CHECK: Stage Presence 1]**

**Success:** You don't perform. You don't try to impress. You simply meet their eyes and tell them: you're here because you wanted to understand, not because you wanted something from them.

**The Happy Ending:** Their smile becomes the first fully real one you've seen from them. "Honesty. How refreshing. Most people want me to make them feel something. You just wanted to understand."

They stand, and the admirers drift back like the tide responding to the moon.

**The Happy Ending:** "The Revisionists have a gathering. Philosophy, mostly—how stories could be different, should be different. It's where we discuss what revision really means." They extend a hand in invitation. "Would you like to come? Not as a believer. Just as someone who wants to understand."

**Failure:** You try too hard. Your answer comes out polished, charming, exactly what you think they want to hear. And they recognize it immediately.

**The Happy Ending:** "Oh, honey." Their disappointment is gentle, which makes it worse. "That was very good. Almost real." They pat your hand. "Come back when you're ready to drop the act. I've had enough performances to last several lifetimes."

The admirers close back around them, and you find yourself on the outside of the circle.
