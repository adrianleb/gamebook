## Node 229: Warning Others

*The Archives — The Path Back / The Green Room*

The truth you've discovered isn't just your truth. It belongs to everyone in the Understage—every story, every character, every faction that thinks they're safe in their corner of this impossible place. The Editor's Final Draft doesn't care about faction lines. Neither should the warning.

The Understudy follows as you begin the journey back toward the Green Room.

**The Understudy:** "You're not just going to your faction, are you?"

"I'm going to everyone. The Director. The Revisionists. The Exiters. CHORUS. Anyone who'll listen."

**The Understudy:** "That's... ambitious. Most of them won't trust you. Some actively hate each other."

"Then I'll have to be convincing."

### The Warning Campaign

The Green Room is never truly quiet, but there are moments between the chaos—gaps in the noise where a voice can carry. You find one of those moments and you use it.

You don't go to the factions' corners. You go to the center. To the open space where CHORUS sometimes performs. To the place where everyone can see you.

**You:** "I've been to the Author's Desk."

The noise doesn't stop, but it changes. People are listening.

**You:** "I've seen the Final Draft. The story the Editor is writing. And I need you to understand something—all of you."

The factions watch from their respective territories. The Director's mask-face is unreadable. The Exiters are tense, suspicious. The Revisionists look curious despite themselves.

**You:** "The Editor doesn't care about Preservationist or Revisionist. They don't care about who wants to stay or who wants to leave. The Final Draft doesn't have factions. It has *characters*. And when it's finished, we'll all be those characters—or we'll be nothing at all."

Murmurs. Whispers. You can feel the room's mood shifting, but you're not sure which way.

This is the moment. You need to convince them—not with facts alone, but with the kind of improvised connection that turns strangers into allies.

**[STAT CHECK: Improv 3 — Advanced]**

*This check requires adaptability and persuasion—the ability to read a crowd and speak to their fears.*

---

**Success:**

You see the moment it lands. The Fear. Not just yours—theirs. The sudden, visceral understanding that their stories, their identities, their *existence* is at stake.

**CHORUS** emerges from the shadows, their collective voice harmonizing around your words.

**CHORUS:** "The Prompter speaks truth. We have heard the scratching of the pen. We have felt the weight of revision."

**The Director** steps forward, their mask-face somehow conveying reluctant agreement.

**The Director:** "If the Editor completes their work, there will be nothing left to preserve. Perhaps... temporary cooperation is warranted."

**The Final Girl** appears at the edge of the Exiter territory, her voice cutting through the murmurs.

**The Final Girl:** "We've been trying to leave because we didn't think anything could follow us. If the Editor can rewrite the boundary itself..."

**The Unfinished Quest** raises their incomplete sword.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "Then we're all stories facing the same ending. And that changes things."

It's not unity—not yet. But it's a start. Representatives from every faction, looking at each other without hostility for perhaps the first time. Looking at *you* as the one who made them see.

**Flag Set:** `COALITION_FORMED`
**Flag Set:** `CROSS_FACTION_ALLIANCE`

**The Understudy:** They're grinning, actually grinning. "You did it. You actually got them to listen to each other."

"They're listening," you correct. "Whether they'll keep listening in Act 3 is a different question."

But for now, it's enough.

**Failure:**

You see the moment it doesn't land. The skepticism. The old grievances rising to the surface, stronger than any warning you can offer.

**A Preservationist Voice:** "This is just Revisionist propaganda! They want us scared so they can push their 'improvements'!"

**A Revisionist Voice:** "As if the Preservationists aren't the ones who let things get this bad in the first place!"

**An Exiter Voice:** "Why should we care? Let them rewrite each other. We'll be gone before it matters!"

The room dissolves into argument. Your message is lost in the noise of old feuds and older fears. People are talking—but not to each other. Not about the Editor. About the same things they've always fought about.

**The Understudy:** "We should go. Before someone decides to blame us for stirring things up."

They're right. The warning failed. Not completely—some people heard you. Some people will remember. But the coalition you hoped for isn't forming.

**Flag Set:** `WARNING_FAILED`
**Flag Set:** `PANIC_SPREADING`

Instead of unity, you've created confusion. Fear without direction. In Act 3, you'll face a fractured Understage—factions that know something is wrong but can't agree on what to do about it.

**The Understudy:** "It wasn't your fault. These divisions have been here for longer than either of us."

"I know," you say. "I just hoped that a big enough threat might overcome them."

Some things can't be bridged with words alone. In Act 3, you'll have to try a different approach.

→ Go to **Act 2 Conclusion** (Node 230)

**Choices:**

1. *(Success)* A coalition is forming. Proceed to Act 3 with cross-faction support. → Node 230 (Act 2 Conclusion)

2. *(Failure)* The warning has spread fear without focus. Proceed to Act 3 amid factional chaos. → Node 230 (Act 2 Conclusion)

---

**Flags Set:**
- `WARNING_ATTEMPTED`
- Success: `COALITION_FORMED`, `CROSS_FACTION_ALLIANCE`
- Failure: `WARNING_FAILED`, `PANIC_SPREADING`

**Notes:**
- Improv 3 is an Advanced-level check, challenging but not Expert
- Success creates unique Act 3 conditions: allies from all factions
- Failure doesn't block progress but creates disadvantage: divided, fearful Understage
- The scene showcases representatives from multiple factions (CHORUS, Director, Final Girl, Unfinished Quest)
- Even in failure, some seeds are planted—not everyone ignored the warning
- The Understudy's reaction emphasizes player agency: they *tried*, which matters

**Design Intent:**
- Reward Improv-focused builds with dramatic coalition-building scene
- The factional representatives reacting shows world responsiveness
- Success is significant: cross-faction alliance is rare and powerful
- Failure is interesting: panic and division create different Act 3 challenges
- This path emphasizes social action over individual investigation or confrontation
