## Node 108: The Final Girl

*The Green Room — The Alcove of Shadows*

The woman in the alcove watches you approach with the practiced alertness of someone who's learned that anything can become a threat. Her posture is casual—legs crossed, drink in hand—but you notice her eyes have already catalogued the exits, the nearby objects that could serve as weapons, the distance between you and her.

You've seen that look before. In horror stories. In survivors.

**The Final Girl:** "Three." She speaks before you can. "That's how many steps you took after I first noticed you looking. Most people take five or six. You're faster than average. Or more desperate."

She sips her drink. It might be water. It might be something stronger. Hard to tell, and she doesn't seem inclined to share.

**The Final Girl:** "You want to talk. Everyone wants to talk. The Preservationists want to know how I 'broke the cycle.' The Revisionists want to study my 'pattern disruption.' The Exiters want me to join their cause." A ghost of a smile. "I'm not interested in causes. Causes get you killed."

She sets down her drink.

**The Final Girl:** "I survived seven sequels. Do you understand what that means? I watched every friend I made die. The funny one. The brave one. The one who deserved to make it. Dead, dead, dead. And me?" She taps her chest. "Still here. Still standing at the end. Because that's my role."

Her eyes hold yours, testing something.

**The Final Girl:** "So. What do you want from the girl who's seen it all and buried everyone?"

She's looking for something real. Not performance, not agenda—something genuine that doesn't smell like script.

**[STAT CHECK: Improv 2]**

**Success:** You don't give her a pitch. You don't offer a deal. Instead, you ask what *she* wants. Not what you want from her—what she's looking for in this place between stories.

The Final Girl is silent for a long moment. When she speaks again, her voice is different. Softer. More human.

**The Final Girl:** "What do I want?" A real laugh, surprised. "Nobody asks that. They assume they know—survival, right? That's my thing." She shakes her head. "I want to save someone. Anyone. For once, I want someone else to make it to the credits because of something I did."

She studies you with new eyes.

**The Final Girl:** "You're not aligned with any faction. I can tell—you don't have the stink of true belief on you." She stands. "Good. The factions are all playing the same game. They just think they're different games. If you want to know how things really work here—come find me later. I'll teach you what survival actually looks like."

**Failure:** You give her a reason. A good reason, maybe—logical, well-reasoned. But it sounds like a line from a script. Like something you were supposed to say.

**The Final Girl:** "Mmhm." She picks up her drink again, dismissing you. "I've heard better. Come back when you have something that doesn't sound like a director fed it to you."

Her attention shifts to the room at large, watching for threats you can't see. You've become background noise.
