## Node 114: Revisionist Philosophy

*The Green Room — The Garden Room*

The Happy Ending leads you to a space that shouldn't exist in the Green Room—a garden, indoor but somehow receiving real sunlight, filled with flowers from a hundred different stories. Roses from romances. Lilies from tragedies. Strange blooms from fantasies no one finished.

A small group has gathered here. Characters from different genres, different traditions, all listening to a speaker whose form keeps shifting—as if they haven't decided what they want to look like yet.

**The Happy Ending:** "Welcome to the Revisionist Salon." Their voice is soft, intimate. "We don't recruit. We discuss. And if what we discuss resonates with you—then perhaps we'll talk more."

The shifting speaker notices your arrival and pauses mid-sentence.

**The Shifting Speaker:** "A new perspective! Excellent. Fresh eyes see old problems differently." Their form settles on something androgynous and welcoming. "We were discussing the central question: does authorship grant ownership? If a writer creates a character, does the character belong to the writer—or to themselves?"

The Happy Ending guides you to a seat.

**The Happy Ending:** "This is the heart of Revisionism. Not destruction—*revision*. The belief that what was written can be rewritten, should be rewritten, when the first draft causes suffering."

They gesture to the other listeners.

**The Happy Ending:** "Everyone here has a story they would change. Not escape—that's the Exiters. Not preserve—that's the Preservationists. Change. Improve. Give agency to those who had none."

The Shifting Speaker continues their lecture, and you find yourself drawn in. The philosophy is seductive: every story has victims, has characters forced into suffering for narrative purposes. What if those characters could revise their roles?

Eventually, The Happy Ending leans close.

**The Happy Ending:** "You've heard the basics. Now I'll ask: do you understand? Not agree—understand. Can you see why someone might want this?"

Understanding Revisionist philosophy requires grasping its nuances—not just the appeal, but the deeper implications.

**[STAT CHECK: Script 3]**

**Success:** You don't just parrot back what you've heard. You engage with the philosophy—its strengths, its dangers, its implications. You ask questions that show you've thought it through.

The Happy Ending's eyes shine with something like recognition.

**The Happy Ending:** "You *understand*. You see both the beauty and the danger." They take your hand. "That's rare. Most people see revision as either salvation or destruction. You see it as what it is: a tool. Powerful. Dangerous. Necessary."

The Shifting Speaker drifts closer.

**The Shifting Speaker:** "Perhaps you'd like to learn more. The Revisionists have methods—ways of making small changes, testing the limits of what can be revised." They smile mysteriously. "Nothing dangerous. Yet. But if you want to understand what's possible in the Understage..."

**The Happy Ending:** "They're offering access. Real access, not just philosophy. What's happening in the Archives, the Editor, the Final Draft—we have theories. And we might have solutions."

**Failure:** You try to engage, but the philosophy slips through your fingers. You're asking the wrong questions, or asking them the wrong way. The nuances escape you.

**The Happy Ending:** "Ah." Disappointment, gentle but present. "You're not ready for the deeper discussion. That's not a criticism—many people aren't. Revision is dangerous precisely because it requires such careful thought."

They pat your hand.

**The Happy Ending:** "Stay for the salon if you like. Listen. Learn. When the philosophy makes sense—not just emotionally, but intellectually—come find me."

The Shifting Speaker has already turned back to the group, continuing their lecture. You're welcome to stay, but you're not invited deeper.
