## Node 132: CHORUS Backdoor

*The Green Room — The Forgotten Way*

CHORUS gathers around you—three of them, or five, or perhaps just one with echoes. They move in fragments, speaking in overlapping whispers that somehow resolve into clarity when you focus.

**CHORUS:** "—this way, this way—" "—the Director built the formal paths—" "—but we remember the ones they forgot—" "—or pretend to forget—"

They lead you behind the prop curtain into darkness. Not the dramatic darkness of a stage blackout, but the ordinary darkness of spaces that have been overlooked. Dusty, cramped, smelling of mothballs and old ink.

**CHORUS:** "—stay close—" "—the passages shift for those who don't know—" "—but we know—" "—we always know—"

The route is labyrinthine. Stairs that spiral in directions you're not sure exist. Doors that open onto brief glimpses of scenes—a ballroom, a battlefield, a child's bedroom with a monster under the bed—before CHORUS hurries you past. The Green Room, you realize, is much larger than its visible spaces suggest.

**[STAT CHECK: Improv 2]**

**Success:** You follow CHORUS's fragmented directions intuitively, reading their overlapping suggestions like a score of music. Left when half of them point left and the other half point right—but the rightward pointers are echoes, a moment behind. You understand their rhythm.

"—they learn quickly—" "—not many do—" "—the Archives will like this one—"

You emerge into a narrow alcove behind the main entrance, unseen and unobserved. The Archives stretch before you—vast, ancient, and entirely yours to explore without supervision.

**Failure:** The directions tangle. CHORUS points everywhere and nowhere, their voices splitting into fragments you can't reassemble. You stumble through wrong turns, narrowly avoid stepping into a tragedy's death scene, and eventually emerge—but not cleanly.

"—arrived, arrived—" "—but noticed, perhaps—" "—the passages remember clumsy feet—"

You're in the Archives, but your entrance was heard. The Lost Pages stir in distant stacks, curious about the disturbance. You'll need to be more careful from here.
