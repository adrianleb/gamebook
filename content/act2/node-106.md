## Node 106: The Solved Case

*The Green Room — The Solved Case's Corner*

You approach the woman in the trench coat. Up close, she's older than she first appeared—or perhaps age works differently for characters who've lived through too many cases. Smoke curls from a cigarette that isn't there; the habit persists even without the prop.

She doesn't look up as you reach her table. A spread of photographs lies before her, though the images seem to shift when you're not looking directly at them.

**The Solved Case:** "Sit or don't. Standing makes you look like a suspect." Her voice is clipped, precise—every word a deduction. "You're the new one. The Prompter's replacement, or successor, or whatever polite word they're using now."

She finally meets your eyes. Hers are tired in a way that has nothing to do with sleep.

**The Solved Case:** "I've solved a hundred cases. A thousand. I've found killers and cleared the innocent and brought justice to the unjust. All of it written. All of it predetermined." She taps the photographs. "You know what case I can't solve? Who killed my partner. Page one of my story—Marlowe's dead. Here's your motivation, detective. Go catch the bad guy."

Her fingers tighten on the glass.

**The Solved Case:** "I found the author's notes. 'Marlowe dies to give protagonist depth.' Not a killer. A *narrative choice*." She takes a drink that isn't there. "So. You want something from me. Everyone does. Make your case."

You need to present yourself as someone worth her time—someone who thinks, who investigates, who doesn't just stumble through stories looking for the next plot point.

**[STAT CHECK: Script 2]**

**Success:** You lay out what you know: the breach, the crisis, the Editor's presence in the margins. You connect the dots, showing her the pattern you've observed. Not conclusions—observations. Evidence. The language she speaks.

**The Solved Case:** Something shifts in her expression. Not warmth, exactly, but recognition. "You think like an investigator. Good. Most Prompters think like heroes—all action, no deduction."

She slides one of the photographs toward you. It shows a desk covered in papers, red ink visible even in the image.

**The Solved Case:** "The Archives. Something's happening there. Someone's editing things that shouldn't be edited. I'm building a case, but I need someone who can move where I can't." She pauses. "The Director trusts me. That means there are doors that stay closed when I approach. You're new. Unaligned. You could get through."

She extends a hand—not for a shake, but to seal a partnership.

**The Solved Case:** "Work with me. Help me investigate. And maybe we both find answers."

**Failure:** You try to explain your situation, but it comes out jumbled—too much feeling, not enough evidence. You're telling a story when she needs facts.

**The Solved Case:** "Amateur." She returns to her photographs. "Come back when you've learned to separate what you want to believe from what you can prove. I don't work with wishful thinkers."

The dismissal is complete. She's already looking past you, mind on the next case.
