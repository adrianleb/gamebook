## Node 121: The Looping Tale

*Inside the Story — The Tower*

The transition is seamless and nauseating. One moment you're in the Green Room's warmth; the next, you're in a tower that exists in perpetual fairy-tale afternoon. The stones are the color of impossible castles, the sky outside the window is permanently sunset, and somewhere below, a dragon that isn't a dragon waits for a prince that isn't a prince.

The Eternal Princess stands by the window, mid-curtsy. She freezes when she sees you—an interruption to a script she's performed for centuries.

**Eternal Princess:** "You're not..." Her voice is rust and repetition. "You're not in the story. How are you not in the story?"

She moves toward you, and every step seems to cost her something. This close, you can see the wear—not age, exactly, but *repetition*. The same gestures, worn smooth like stone steps.

**Eternal Princess:** "Are you here to save me?" A bitter laugh. "Everyone comes to save me. The prince. The rival. The comic sidekick. They all save me. And then it *resets*."

The room flickers. For a moment, you see it as it "should" be—you gone, the princess in position, the dragon's roar on cue. The loop trying to reassert itself.

**Eternal Princess:** "The window." She grabs your arm with surprising strength. "I've tried everything. Jumping. Hiding. Fighting the dragon myself. The story always corrects. But you—you're not *in* the story. Maybe you can..."

She trails off, hope and despair fighting in her expression.

**[STAT CHECK: Script 3]**

**Success:** You study the loop's mechanics. Every story has an anchor—a moment that defines its structure. This one is built around the rescue: the prince, the dragon, the saved princess. But the anchor isn't the rescue itself. It's the *waiting*. The princess must wait to be saved. Remove the waiting, and the loop loses its hold.

**You:** "The revision can't happen at the end. It has to happen at the beginning. You don't need someone to save you—you need to *never be captured in the first place*."

The princess stares at you. "That's... that's not possible. The tower is where the story starts."

**You:** "Then we change where the story starts."

→ Go to Node 122 (attempt revision)

**Failure:** The loop's structure is too complex, too old. You try to find the anchor point, but centuries of repetition have worn the narrative smooth. There's no edge to grip, no fault to exploit.

The room flickers again, harder this time. You feel yourself being pushed out—an antibody rejecting a foreign element.

**Eternal Princess:** "No. No, don't leave me here—"

Her voice fades as the story ejects you. You tumble back into the Green Room, disoriented and empty-handed. The loop continues.

**CHORUS (sympathetic):** "*The tale is old—*" "*—very old—*" "*—perhaps another approach—*" "*—or another helper—*"

The mission isn't over. The Happy Ending will have suggestions, and CHORUS may know alternative methods.

→ Return to the loop (retry with different approach) → Node 121
→ Report difficulty to The Happy Ending → Node 120 (receive assistance)

---

**Flags Possible:**
- Success unlocks the revision attempt
- Failure allows retry with CHORUS assistance (grants +1 to next attempt)
