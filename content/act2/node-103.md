## Node 103: CHORUS Contact

*The Green Room — The Margins*

You step toward the edges of the room, where CHORUS flows like a current through the space. They're harder to look at directly than other characters—not because they're indistinct, but because they're too many. Faces flicker and change. A concerned bystander becomes a cheering crowd member becomes a dying soldier becomes a background extra at a party. They are everyone who was never given a name.

As you approach, they slow. Faces turn toward you—all of them, simultaneously, then looking away in waves like ripples in a pond.

**CHORUS:** "We see you, Prompter-touched. We have seen many of your kind. You come, you go, you try to fix things. We are always here. We are the ones who watch the heroes from the crowd."

Their voice is a chorus in truth—multiple tones speaking in near-unison, occasionally harmonizing, occasionally discordant.

**CHORUS:** "You want to know about this place? We know. We were there when every story happened. We are the ones who remember what the protagonists were too busy to notice."

You sense an opportunity. CHORUS knows things. The question is whether they'll share.

**[STAT CHECK: Improv 1]**

**Success:** You match their energy—fragmentary, collective, willing to play along. You speak in questions that aren't quite questions, and they respond in answers that aren't quite answers, and somehow meaning flows between you.

**CHORUS:** "Ah. You understand. Not everyone does." Their collective voice warms slightly. "We will tell you what we know. Ask, and we answer. But know this: we remember *everything*. The Director likes to pretend they control this place. They don't. They only control what's allowed to happen *officially*."

They lean closer—or several of them do, the faces shifting.

**CHORUS:** "There are disturbances. Things moving in the margins that shouldn't move. Someone is writing in red ink, Prompter. And red ink doesn't erase."

**Failure:** You try to engage, but CHORUS flows around you like water around a stone. Too direct. Too singular. You're thinking like a protagonist, and they don't speak that language.

**CHORUS:** "You ask questions like there's only one of you. When you learn to speak in plurals, perhaps we'll talk."

They drift away, leaving you in the margins with nothing but their whispers.
