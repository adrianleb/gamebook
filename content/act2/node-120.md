## Node 120: Revisionist Mission Briefing

*The Green Room — The Gathering Corner*

The Happy Ending has assembled a small group in the warmest corner of the Green Room—a space where the lighting seems perpetually golden, where the chairs are just comfortable enough. CHORUS members drift through, their voices harmonizing with the soft music that plays from no visible source.

The atmosphere feels intentional. Designed. You're being presented with something, and everyone here knows their role except you.

**The Happy Ending:** "Thank you for coming." They speak with genuine warmth, but their eyes are sharp. "I know the Director has been courting you. The Solved Case, too. But before you commit to their vision of order..." They gesture to someone standing in the shadows.

A woman steps forward—older, tired, her movements mechanical in a way that hurts to watch. She repeats a curtsy, then stops, then begins again. The same curtsy. The same angle. The same frozen smile.

**The Happy Ending:** "Meet the Eternal Princess. She's been curtsying for three hundred years."

**CHORUS (in broken harmony):** "*Her story loops—*" "*—the rescue comes—*" "*—she's saved—*" "*—but then it resets—*" "*—again and again and again—*"

The Eternal Princess completes her curtsy. Resets. Begins again.

**The Happy Ending:** "Her story is a fairy tale. Ancient, beloved, passed down through generations. The prince saves the princess, they live happily ever after, the end." Their voice tightens. "Except it's not the end. The story is read again. And again. And each time, she wakes in the tower. Each time, she waits. Each time, she's rescued. Each time..."

They don't finish. They don't need to.

**The Happy Ending:** "The Preservationists would call this justice. The story functions as designed. But is it *right*?" They meet your eyes. "We can edit her tale. Give her agency. Let her save herself, or simply... let her story end. Truly end."

**CHORUS:** "*But editing is dangerous—*" "*—we need someone—*" "*—to enter the loop—*" "*—and change it from within—*"

The mission is clear: enter the Eternal Princess's looping tale and revise it. But revision is not preservation. This is a commitment to change.
