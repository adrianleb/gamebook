## Node 104: Director's Briefing

*The Green Room — The Director's Private Alcove*

The Director leads you to a curtained alcove behind their platform. The space is smaller than it looks from outside—intimate, even cozy. Theatrical memorabilia covers the walls: playbills from shows that never existed, photographs of casts that couldn't have been real, a director's chair with a name worn to illegibility.

They pour two drinks from a decanter that seems to contain something different depending on how the light hits it. They hand you one. It tastes like nostalgia and stage fright.

**The Director:** "You impressed me out there. Not many newcomers do." They settle into their chair with the practiced ease of someone who's held court for centuries. "So I'll give you the truth—or at least, a truth. The version that's most useful for someone in your position."

They gesture broadly at the walls, at the Green Room beyond, at everything.

**The Director:** "This place exists because stories need somewhere to go between readings. Characters need rest. Narratives need maintenance. I've managed that process for a very long time—keeping the peace, resolving disputes, ensuring that fictional beings don't forget their purpose."

A pause. Their expression shifts to something more guarded.

**The Director:** "But lately, something has changed. Characters are restless. More breaches than usual. More... instability. Someone is editing the fundamental structure of this place, and they're not being subtle about it." They lean forward. "I believe you came here because of those breaches. The question is: what do you intend to do about them?"

You sense they're offering you a choice—align with their vision of order, or chart your own course.

**Choices:**

1. "I want to understand the situation fully before I act." → The Director nods approvingly. "Prudent. The Call Board has postings from all factions. Study them. Learn the perspectives. Then choose." They press a small gold pin into your palm—the Director's favor. "This will open doors. Use it wisely."
→ Go to Node 105 (Call Board Discovery)
**Flags Set:** `PRESERVATIONIST: +1`

2. "I prefer to form my own opinions without guidance." → The Director's expression flickers—disappointment, perhaps, or something like respect for defiance. "Independent-minded. We'll see if that serves you or dooms you. The Green Room is open to you. Explore. Make your own judgments." They don't offer the pin.
