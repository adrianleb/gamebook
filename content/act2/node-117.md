## Node 117: Fragment Confrontation

*The Green Room — The Unfinished Room*

The Bleeding Fragment sits on his half-drawn bed, watching you with eyes that keep forgetting their color. The room around you feels unstable—not dangerous, but uncertain, like a sentence waiting for its ending.

**Bleeding Fragment:** "They want to put me in a story." It's not a question. "The Director sent you. The detective lady. They want to give me an ending."

He pulls his knees to his chest—a gesture that seems borrowed from a dozen different narratives, never quite his own.

**Bleeding Fragment:** "I heard them talking. A children's adventure. A lost boy who gets found." His voice wavers. "They think that'll fix me. Make me complete. But..."

He looks up at you, and for a moment his features stabilize—a real child, frightened and alone, caught between stories.

**Bleeding Fragment:** "What if I don't want their ending? What if I want to find my own?"

This is the moral heart of the Preservationist path. The Director's solution is elegant, contained, correct by every traditional measure. But the boy before you is asking for something else—the chance to be incomplete on his own terms.

You need to handle this carefully. Calm him, convince him, or simply capture him—the approach matters.

**[APPROACH CHECK: Stage Presence 2 OR Script 2]**

**Success:** You speak to him—not as a hunter to prey, but as one story-shaped being to another. You explain what you've learned about the Understage, about the nature of characters and endings, about the genuine danger his unfinishedness poses to others.

But you also listen. You hear about the silence where his author's voice should be. The half-remembered warmth of being written, followed by the cold of being abandoned. The fear that any ending they give him will be wrong because it won't be *his*.

**Bleeding Fragment:** "You actually listened." He sounds surprised. "Most people just... recite their lines at me."

He reaches under his sketched pillow and pulls out something that glints with dangerous potential—a fragment of red ink, crystallized into a sharp point.

**Bleeding Fragment:** "I found this. In the Archives. It's from the Editor's desk." He holds it out to you. "I'll go with you. Wherever you want to take me. But I want you to know what I found. Something's happening. The person doing it... they're not just editing. They're *erasing*."

You have the Fragment's cooperation and a clue about the Editor's activities. Now you must choose what to do with him.

→ Return the Fragment to the prepared story (Preservationist resolution) → Node 119
→ Help the Fragment hide instead (betray the mission) → Node 127
→ Take the intel to the Archives first → Node 130

**Failure:** You try to reason with him, but your approach is too formal, too much like the authorities he fears. The Fragment's eyes widen, and the room around you destabilizes—walls become suggestions, floor becomes theory.

**Bleeding Fragment:** "You're just like them. Reciting your role."

He doesn't run—he *fragments*. Pieces of him scatter through the Dressing Rooms like pages from a torn book. You've lost him, temporarily, but the contamination he leaves behind gives you a trail.

CHORUS whispers through the walls: "*He's frightened—*" "*—not malicious—*" "*—try gentleness, perhaps—*"

You'll need to track him again, but now you understand him better. The next approach should account for his fear.

→ Track the scattered fragments (continue pursuit) → Node 116 (retry with advantage)
→ Report partial failure to the Director → Node 119 (partial resolution)

**Flags Possible:**
- Success unlocks moral choice between Preservationist and Exiter paths
