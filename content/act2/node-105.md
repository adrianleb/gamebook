## Node 105: Call Board Discovery

*The Green Room — The Call Board*

The Call Board dominates the western wall of the Main Lounge—a massive corkboard that somehow contains more notices than its surface should allow. Papers overlap and layer, some ancient and yellowed, others crisp and new. You can see them shifting subtly when you're not looking directly at them, rearranging themselves according to some internal logic.

Faction symbols mark many of the notices. Gold pins for Preservationist postings. Silver ribbons for Revisionist requests. Copper clasps for Exiter concerns. And unmarked ones—neutral, unclaimed, or something else entirely.

You scan the postings:

**[GOLD PIN — PRESERVATIONIST]**
*ESCAPED CHARACTER SIGHTING — CONTAINMENT NEEDED*
A character from an incomplete tragedy has been seen in the lower stacks. They're causing narrative bleed—nearby characters are developing tragic tendencies. Return them to their story before the damage spreads.
*Contact: The Solved Case*

**[SILVER RIBBON — REVISIONIST]**
*STORY FRAGMENT CORRUPTED — ASSISTANCE REQUESTED*
A fairy tale has become stuck in a loop. The same ending plays out repeatedly, and the characters within are suffering. Revision expertise needed to break the cycle and allow organic resolution.
*Contact: The Happy Ending*

**[COPPER CLASP — EXITER]**
*SAFE PASSAGE REQUIRED — DISCRETE HELP WANTED*
A side character from a tragedy seeks permanent exit from their narrative. Preservationist patrols make the usual routes dangerous. Someone to run distraction or guide them through back passages needed.
*Contact: The Unfinished Quest*

**[UNMARKED — NEUTRAL]**
*THE ARCHIVES SEEK RESEARCHERS*
Disturbances in the lower stacks have made research difficult. Someone with investigation skills needed to catalog anomalies and report findings. Access to restricted sections available for qualified candidates.
*No listed contact—report to the Archives entrance*

You also notice, half-hidden beneath newer postings, an older notice. The paper is different—heavier, with a watermark you can't quite make out. The writing is in red ink:

*THE FINAL DRAFT IS COMING. SOME STORIES WILL END. CHOOSE WISELY WHICH ONES YOU WANT TO SAVE.*

No signature. No faction symbol. Just those words, and the faint smell of something like old books and burning.

The Green Room continues around you. Characters mingle. CHORUS whispers in the margins. The Director watches from their platform.

What will you do?
