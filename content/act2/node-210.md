## Node 210: The Trail Deepens

*The Archives — The Investigation Hub*

You stand at a crossroads in the Archives. The path forward exists, but it branches into darkness, each direction holding answers you need and dangers you can't predict.

The Understudy examines a map they've been constructing—a fragmentary diagram of the Archives' impossible geography. "We know the Author's Desk exists. We know someone is using it to edit the Archives. But we need more before we can approach it safely." They trace three routes on their diagram. "Evidence. Proof. Something that will let us understand what we're walking into."

Above you, the shelves stretch toward a ceiling that might not exist. Somewhere in the distance, you hear the scratch of a pen on paper—continuous, relentless. The Editor is working, even now.

### Current Investigation Progress

Check your clues:

**Evidence Gathered:**
- *First Draft Fragment* (`HAS_FIRST_DRAFT`) — The original manuscript, before revisions
- *Margin Notes* (`HAS_MARGIN_NOTES`) — The Editor's annotations, revealing their thought process
- *Understudy's Mirror* (`HAS_UNDERSTUDY_MIRROR`) — A lens for seeing truth beneath appearance

**[DISCOVERY CHAIN: 3 clues required to unlock safe approach]**

---

### If you have 3 or more clues:

The evidence assembles itself into a complete picture. You understand the Editor's method, their motivation, their vulnerability. The path to the Author's Desk is clear—and more importantly, you know what to do when you get there.

**The Understudy:** "We have enough. Whatever's at that Desk, we're ready for it."

The three clues in your possession form a key of sorts. The First Draft shows you what the Archives were meant to be. The Margin Notes reveal how they've been changed. And the Mirror—if you have it—shows what the Editor truly is. Together, these aren't just information. They're protection.

**Flags Set:** `REVELATION_UNLOCKED`

→ Proceed to Node 215 (Author's Desk Approach)

---

### If you have fewer than 3 clues:

The picture is incomplete. You could approach the Author's Desk now, but you'd be walking in partially blind. The Understudy shakes their head.

**The Understudy:** "We need more. Rushing in unprepared..." They don't finish the sentence. They don't need to.

Three paths lead to three different sources of evidence. Each is dangerous in its own way. Each will bring you closer to understanding what you're facing.

---

**Choices:**

1. **Search for the First Draft** — Somewhere in the Archives is the original manuscript—the version before any editing. It might reveal the Editor's first intentions.
*Seek the text that predates all revision.*
→ Go to Node 211 (Clue A - The First Draft)

2. **Decipher the Margin Notes** — The Editor's annotations are scattered throughout the Archives. Gathered together, they might reveal a pattern—a thought process that can be understood and predicted.
*Follow the trail of red ink.*
→ Go to Node 212 (Clue B - The Margin Notes)

3. **[Requires `UNDERSTUDY_PARTNER` confirmed]** **Use the Understudy's Mirror** — The Understudy's recovered mirror shows truth beneath appearance. Turn it toward the question of the Editor, and see what it reveals.
*Look into the glass and ask what's real.*
→ Go to Node 213 (Clue C - The Understudy's Mirror)

4. **[If `PAGES_BEFRIENDED`]** **Consult the Lost Pages again** — The fragments might know more than they revealed. Return to the margins and ask deeper questions.
*Those who were cut away remember what was cut.*
→ Return to Node 208 with new context

5. **[If you have at least 1 clue]** **Risk approaching the Author's Desk with partial information** — Dangerous, but time may be running out. The sound of that pen hasn't stopped.
*Sometimes you have to act before you're ready.*
→ Go to Node 215 (Author's Desk Approach) with disadvantage

### Environmental Detail

As you consider your options, the Archives shift around you. Shelves rearrange themselves with paper-whisper sounds. The Understudy watches the movements with unease.

**The Understudy:** "The Archives are responding to something. They're... reorganizing. Like a story being revised while you're reading it."

They're right. You can feel it—a pressure, a sense of acceleration. Whatever the Editor is doing, it's building toward something. The Final Draft isn't a distant goal. It's approaching completion.

**The Understudy:** "We should hurry. But we should also be thorough. Those two things are about to become incompatible."

Above you, in the shadows between shelves, something watches. Not The Critic—not yet. But awareness. Attention. The Editor knows someone is investigating.

The question is: how long before they act?

---

**Notes:**
- This is the investigation hub, tracking clue progress and branching to three distinct clue paths.
- Players who skipped here from failure states have the opportunity to gather evidence systematically.
- The pressure to hurry adds tension without forcing immediate action.
- Node 215 (Author's Desk Approach) can be reached directly with 3 clues or with disadvantage from fewer.
- The Lost Pages callback (if befriended) provides an alternate path for players who succeeded at Node 208.
- The "something watches" detail builds tension for the upcoming Critic encounter.
