## Node 343: The New Editor

*The Mainstage — Center Stage*

The former Editor watches you work. Their form grows fainter with each revision you make, as if the role itself is transferring—not just the power, but the weight of it.

"I thought I'd feel relief," they say. "I do, I think. But also..." They trail off. Some things can't be put into words, even by those who reshape words for a living.

Your allies gather around you. Those who survived. Those who stayed.

[If `STAGEHAND_CURIOUS`:]
The Stagehand approaches, their expression unreadable. "The Stagehand remembers now," they say quietly. "You holding the pen—it opened something. I was... I was a character the last Editor tried to save. They cut me from my story to protect me. But the cutting cost me everything I was." They look at the former Editor, who turns away. "I don't blame them. I don't think I do. But I remember now."

[If `UNDERSTUDY_PARTNER`:]
The Understudy studies you with something between hope and fear. "What happens to replacements now?" they ask. "When characters escape, when stories need filling—will you still make more of us? Or will you..." They can't finish the question. You're not sure you can answer it.

[If `SOLVED_CASE_PARTNER`:]
The Solved Case tips their hat to you. "Justice," they say. "That's what you've got now. The power to write fair endings into stories that never had them. Don't waste it on revenge." They pause. "But don't forget what we're owed, either."

[If `QUEST_ALLY`:]
The Unfinished Quest stands at attention, then relaxes. "I guess I can finally stop training for a battle that was never mine to fight," they say. "What do heroes do when the quest is actually over?"

[If `FINAL_GIRL_TRUST`:]
The Final Girl just nods. "Survival isn't the same as living," she says. "Maybe now we all get to find out what living looks like."

[If `HAPPY_ENDING_FRIEND`:]
The Happy Ending takes your hand, briefly. "Thank you," they say. "Not for the power—for believing that endings should be earned. That characters deserve to choose." They release you. "I'm going to find out if I can love someone without a script. Wish me luck."

One by one, they leave. Back to their stories, or forward into whatever stories they'll write for themselves now. The Mainstage empties.

[If `MAREN_TRUST_HIGH` and not `MAREN_SACRIFICED`:]
Maren remains.

She looks older than when you first met—or perhaps you're seeing her differently now. The weight she carried as Prompter, the decades of holding the boundary alone. You understand it now in a way you couldn't before.

**Maren:** "I thought I'd hand this off to you someday." Her voice is rough. "Not like this. Not with the whole Understage rewritten around us. But here we are."

**You:** "Will you stay?"

She considers the question. Really considers it, turning it over the way she turns over everything.

**Maren:** "For a while. Someone needs to remind you that you're not just an editor—you're also still a person. The former one forgot that. Don't you dare do the same."

[If `MAREN_SACRIFICED`:]
The space where Maren should stand remains empty. You feel her absence like a missing word in a sentence—the meaning still there, but incomplete. She gave herself so you could hold this pen. You will not waste that gift.

You are the Editor now. The role settles into you like ink soaking into paper.

It is permanent.
