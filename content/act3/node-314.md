## Node 314: Ascend the Fly System

*The Mainstage — Fly System Access*

You choose the high ground.

At the edge of the Mainstage, where the wings meet shadow, a ladder rises into darkness. In ordinary theaters, the fly system is mechanical—ropes and pulleys controlling backdrops and scenery. Here in the Understage, the system holds something far more essential.

You grip the first rung and begin to climb.

The ladder takes you past the proscenium's edge, past the borders of performed space, into a realm suspended above story. The air grows thick with tension—not atmospheric, but *narrative*. Every drama needs its high point, and you're ascending toward the literal architecture of climax.

Around you, the fly system reveals itself: not ropes and counterweights, but threads of pure story. They hang in impossible configurations—some taut with tension, others slack with resolution, a few frayed where tales have been forcibly ended. Each thread connects somewhere on the stage below to somewhere in the infinite dark above.

And woven through it all, you recognize patterns. The Editor's work. Stories being pulled, redirected, terminated mid-arc. The threads nearest Center Stage glow with fresh manipulation—the Final Draft's influence made visible.

Navigating this space requires more than skill. It demands the presence to exist where stories haven't finished being told.

**[STAT CHECK: Stage Presence 3]**

**Success:** You move through the rigging like you belong here—like you've always belonged in the space between scenes. Your presence anchors you, makes you *real* enough to walk on narrative threads as if they were solid ground.

The threads respond to your certainty. A path opens through the suspended stories, leading upward toward a vantage point no audience was ever meant to see.

You understand: this is where the story's skeleton lives. From here, you can see how it's all connected—and perhaps where it's vulnerable.

**Failure:** The threads don't recognize you. You're a character in motion, not a stage presence—you don't have the weight to exist in the space between scenes.

The narrative threads slip beneath your feet like caught ropes. You tumble, catching yourself on the ladder just before falling, heart pounding with the vertigo of almost-erasure.

The fly system isn't your path. You descend, rattled but wiser, and seek another approach to the Editor.
