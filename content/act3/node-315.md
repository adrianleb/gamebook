## Node 315: The View from Above

*The Mainstage — Fly System Heights*

You emerge above the story.

The platform—if it can be called that—hangs suspended in the upper reaches of the Mainstage, far beyond where any audience has ever looked. From here, the Understage reveals its true architecture. Not a theater at all, but a *mechanism*. A vast engine for processing narrative, with stories flowing through it like blood through a heart.

And at the heart's center: the Final Draft.

You'd seen the manuscript before, heard it described. But from above, you understand something new. The Final Draft isn't *on* the stage—it *is* the stage. Every floorboard is a page. Every beam and rafter corresponds to a chapter. The Mainstage itself is the Editor's manuscript made manifest, and the Editor stands at its center like an author standing inside their own work.

Which means the stage can be *read*.

The threads around you aren't just narrative—they're *structure*. Scene breaks. Chapter transitions. The places where story mechanics show through the prose. If you can interpret the structural elements, you might identify where the Final Draft—where the stage itself—is vulnerable.

But structural analysis requires more than presence. It demands craft.

**[STAT CHECK: Script 3]**

**Success:** Your Script training activates, parsing the impossible architecture into comprehensible form. You see the story's *bones* beneath its flesh.

*There.* The junction where the Editor's rewrites connect to the original Understage. The seams are visible—not weaknesses, but *transitions*. Places where one narrative reality meets another. If you position yourself at those junctions during the confrontation, you'll have leverage. The Editor controls the stage, but no one controls the spaces between drafts.

You mark the positions in your mind. You know exactly where to descend, where to position allies, where the Editor's control is thinnest.

**Failure:** The structure is beautiful, but incomprehensible. Every time you think you've found a pattern, it shifts—stories within stories, layers of revision obscuring the original design. Your Script knowledge shows you *that* the architecture has meaning, but not *what* that meaning is.

You've seen the scope of what you face. The Editor isn't just editing—they're rewriting reality itself, one page at a time. It's more than you imagined. But understanding the whole picture doesn't give you an advantage, just a clearer sense of the scale.

Time to descend. The confrontation awaits, whether or not you found the exploit you sought.
