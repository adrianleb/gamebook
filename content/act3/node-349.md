## Node 349: Sealing the Passage

*The Mainstage — Center Stage*

The Final Draft hovers before you, its pages alive with potential. Every word pulses with the power to reshape reality, to blur the boundary between what is written and what is real. The Editor understood that power too well.

And so do you.

You look at the manuscript—not with desire, but with the cold clarity of someone who has seen too much. The Understage is beautiful. Dangerous. Alive. And that life spills through the cracks into the real world, carrying stories that should never walk in flesh.

**The Editor:** "So you've chosen preservation." Their voice carries no judgment—only exhaustion, perhaps relief. "To seal what should never have been opened."

[If `EDITOR_WAVERING`:]
"I tried to control it," the Editor says quietly. "To curate which stories could cross, which characters deserved reality. But the cracks only widened. Perhaps... perhaps the only answer is to close them entirely."

[If `MAREN_SACRIFICED`:]
The empty space where Maren stood reminds you why you're here. She gave her life to stop the Editor's plan. You won't let that sacrifice mean nothing. The boundary must hold.

[If `SELF_SACRIFICED`:]
What remains of you is enough to make this choice. Perhaps it's fitting—you've already given part of yourself to end this. Now you'll give the rest to seal it.

You reach toward the Final Draft, but not to claim it. Not to revise it. To destroy it.

The manuscript seems to sense your intent. Its pages flutter wildly, words scrambling, sentences rewriting themselves in desperate pleas: *Don't. We can be different. We can be controlled. We can be—*

But you've seen what happens when stories cannot be controlled. Characters escaping their narratives. Fiction bleeding into reality. The Understage's gifts always come with costs that compound until they consume.

**[If `STAGEHAND_CURIOUS`:]**
The Stagehand watches from the wings, their expression unreadable. "The old ways weren't perfect," they say softly. "But they were... stable. Maybe that's enough."

**[If `PRESERVATIONIST_CHAMPION`:]**
You came to the Understage believing that some things should remain fixed. That the boundary between worlds exists for a reason. Nothing you've seen has changed that conviction—if anything, it's only grown stronger.

The Final Draft's pleas grow more desperate: *Think of all the stories that will never be told! Think of the wonder you're destroying!*

But you also think of the harm. The characters who lost themselves. The reality that warped. The balance that cannot be maintained when fiction and truth collide.

Safety. Permanence. An end to the beautiful, terrible chaos.
