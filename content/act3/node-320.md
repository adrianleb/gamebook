## Node 320: Audience Judgment

*The Mainstage — Before The Audience*

The Audience settles.

That's the worst part. Not anger, not disappointment, not the collective groan of a billion viewers watching the hero stumble. Just... a settling. An acceptance. The acknowledgment that you are what you are, and that will have to be enough.

You feel the weight of their assessment pressing into you. Adequate. Functional. *Sufficient*.

In the grand taxonomy of protagonists, you've been filed somewhere in the middle. Not the chosen one. Not the surprising hero who exceeds expectations. Just someone in a story, doing their best, probably going to be fine. Maybe.

{IF ALLIES_PRESENT}
Your allies look at you with something that might be pity. Or understanding. They know what it feels like to be measured and found wanting—every character in the Understage has faced that judgment at some point. The ones who were cut from earlier drafts. The ones whose arcs got shortened. The ones the audience never quite loved.

"It's okay," the Happy Ending murmurs, if they're present. "The story doesn't have to love us. We just have to finish it."

Easy for them to say. Their role is to be the ending someone else earned. Yours is to stand at the center, whether you deserve to or not.
{ELSE}
Alone before the gathered watchers, you feel the isolation more keenly. There's no one to tell you it's okay, no ally to remind you that protagonists don't have to be exceptional—they just have to keep going.

You have to remind yourself.
{ENDIF}

The question presses against your mind: Do you accept their assessment? Do you carry this judgment into the confrontation with the Editor—the knowledge that The Audience sees you as merely *adequate*?

Or do you find something in yourself that proves them wrong?

**[STAT CHECK: Script 2]**

**Success:** You may not be exceptional, but you *understand* something. You've read enough stories, lived enough chapters, to know that protagonists aren't always the flashiest characters. Sometimes they're just the ones who keep going when everyone else would stop.

The Audience judged you as adequate? Fine. Adequate means surviving. Adequate means reaching the end. Adequate means standing in front of the Editor when this is all over and saying: *I'm still here*.

You accept their assessment without letting it break you. You're not the protagonist of every story—but you're the protagonist of *this* one, and that's a role you can fill.

You walk toward the confrontation with your head held level. Not high, not low. The posture of someone who knows exactly what they are, and has made peace with it.

**Failure:** Their judgment settles into your bones. You try to reject it, try to find the inner fire that would prove The Audience wrong, but the words won't come. The certainty won't form.

Because maybe they're right. Maybe you're not the hero of this story. Maybe you're just... someone. Someone caught up in events beyond their scope, making choices that won't really matter, heading toward a confrontation you're probably going to lose.

The doubt is like ink in water, spreading through everything. You start to question: Why did you come here? Why did you think you could face the Editor? Who decided you were the one to save the Understage—or destroy it, or change it, or whatever you're supposed to do?

No one answers. The Audience watches, patient and eternal, as you wrestle with the weight of your own inadequacy.

Eventually, you walk toward the confrontation. Not with confidence. Not with defiance. With the quiet dread of someone who knows the climax is coming and isn't sure they're ready.

The Editor is going to notice. They always notice doubt.
