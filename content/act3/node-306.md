## Node 306: Center Stage Approach

*The Mainstage — Center Stage Approach*

You choose the measured path.

The journey from the wings to Center Stage should be simple—a straight walk across boards you've crossed a hundred times in theaters above. But this is the Understage, and here, the stage walks back.

The floorboards shift beneath your feet. Not physically—they remain solid wood, worn smooth by a million performances—but their *meaning* slides. One moment you're walking toward the Editor's desk. The next, the desk seems no closer while the wings recede impossibly behind you.

Stage directions materialize in the air. Floating text written in the Editor's precise hand: *ENTER LEFT. CROSS DOWNSTAGE. PAUSE FOR EFFECT.* They hang like theatrical cue cards, but these aren't suggestions. The words tug at your movements, trying to script your approach, to make you a character in *their* narrative rather than the author of your own.

And then the ghosts arrive.

Not literal ghosts—fragments of edited scenes. A sword fight frozen mid-thrust, the combatants stuck between strike and parry. A confession of love, the words hanging unspoken in a character's open mouth. A death scene played on endless loop, the same gasp repeating. These are the moments the Editor has cut, trimmed, revised—and here at the heart of their power, the discarded pieces still linger.

One fragment drifts directly into your path: a farewell scene, two characters embracing. They don't see you, trapped in their eternal goodbye. But if you brush against them, their unfinished narrative could tangle with yours.

**[STAT CHECK: Script 2]**

**Success:** You read the floating stage directions like a Prompter should—not as commands but as *cues*. Where they say ENTER LEFT, you enter right. Where they insist PAUSE, you move. You navigate the narrative interference by contradicting it, your Script knowledge letting you recognize patterns and subvert them.

The fragments part around you, sensing a fellow traveler in the space between stories. You slip through the edited moments without disturbing them, reaching the threshold of the wings at stage right—the last cover before Center Stage proper.

**Failure:** The stage directions catch you. PAUSE, one insists, and your feet slow. CROSS UPSTAGE, another commands, and you find yourself drifting from your intended path. You fight the compulsion, but your Script knowledge isn't strong enough to read the Editor's intent.

Worse, one of the fragment scenes notices your struggle. The farewell embrace breaks apart, the two characters turning toward you with eyes full of desperate need. They've been waiting. Waiting for someone—anyone—to acknowledge them.
