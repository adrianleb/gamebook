## Node 317: Standard Descent

*The Mainstage — Return to Stage Level*

You descend with humility.

The view from above showed you everything and nothing. You saw the scope of the Editor's work—the Final Draft woven into the very substance of the Mainstage, reality rewritten page by page. You understand now that this confrontation isn't just about stopping an editor. It's about challenging someone who has made themselves the author of everything.

But understanding scale isn't the same as finding weakness.

You drop back through the fly system, narrative threads parting around you as you fall. The landing is soft—story cushioning story—and you find yourself backstage, in the shadows at the edge of Center Stage's light.

{IF ALLIES_PRESENT}
Your allies join you, looking to you for direction. You can't give them positions of advantage—you don't know where those positions are. But you can give them something else: honesty.

"The Editor is more than we thought," you say quietly. "This is their world. Their draft. We're just... characters in it."

The Stagehand—or whoever stands closest—meets your eyes. "Then we'll be characters worth reading. Every story needs a twist."

They're right. You don't have tactical advantage. But you have allies who chose to be here, and that counts for something.
{ELSE}
You stand alone in the wings, watching the Editor work. They haven't noticed you yet—or they're pretending not to notice, the way an author pretends not to see their characters moving in peripheral vision.

You saw the whole picture from above. It was beautiful and terrible. The Understage isn't just a place—it's a *work*. And the Editor is trying to complete it, to write an ending for everything. Including you.

No tactical advantage. No special insight into their weaknesses. Just you, and what you've learned, and the choice you're about to make.
{ENDIF}

Perhaps that's enough. Perhaps it has to be.

The Editor waits at Center Stage, pen in hand, revising the final pages of everything. Time to step into the light and see what kind of story this becomes.

**Flags Checked:** None required

**Notes:** This is the "failure" outcome from Node 315, but remains fail-forward—player still reaches the confrontation with full understanding of stakes, just without the mechanical advantage of TACTICAL_POSITION.
