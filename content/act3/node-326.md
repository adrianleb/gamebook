## Node 326: Emotional Appeal

*The Mainstage — Center Stage*

Philosophy and logic—those are the Editor's domains. They've spent years constructing their worldview, fortifying it against every argument. You won't defeat them on that ground.

But they weren't always the Editor.

Once, they were someone else. A Prompter, perhaps. A person with connections and feelings and fears. Somewhere beneath the revisions and the certainty, that person still exists.

You're going to find them.

**You:** "I don't want to debate your philosophy. I want to talk to *you*. Not the Editor—the person who became the Editor."

The Editor stills.

**The Editor:** "That person..." They hesitate. "That person made mistakes that required correction. The Editor is what emerged from those corrections. There's nothing left worth speaking to."

**You:** "I don't believe that. I've met characters who've been rewritten a hundred times, and they still remember who they were. The original never vanishes completely." You step closer, ignoring the power thrumming through the air. "Tell me about before. Before you held the pen. Before the Final Draft. Who were you then?"

This is dangerous ground. You're not attacking their logic—you're attacking their armor. The persona of the Editor exists to protect something fragile. If you push too hard, they'll retreat behind walls of revision and conviction.

But if you reach them...

**Success:** You let your own vulnerability show. This isn't a performance—or rather, it's the most honest kind of performance, where what you're showing is exactly what you feel.

**You:** "I've been a Prompter for... I don't even know how long anymore. Time moves differently here. And the thing I've learned is that every character, every person, carries the weight of who they were. You can't edit that away. It bleeds through."

The Editor's jaw tightens.

**You:** "You talk about the Final Draft like it's purely intellectual—transformation, evolution, necessary sacrifice. But there's something in your voice when you describe the stories you're changing. Something that sounds like grief."

You're close enough now to see the minute changes in their expression. The way their eyes flicker toward the Final Draft. The tension in their hands.

**You:** "Who did you lose? What story broke you badly enough that you decided to break every other story in response?"

The silence that follows is fragile as old paper.

**The Editor:** "..." They look away. When they speak again, their voice is different—quieter, less certain. "There was... someone. Once. In a story I loved more than any other."

The admission seems to cost them something.

**The Editor:** "I watched their narrative play out a thousand times. A million. Every reader who opened that book relived their tragedy, and I... I felt it. Every time. I knew how it ended. I knew there was nothing I could do to change it because *that was how the story was written*."

They turn back to you, and their eyes are bright with old pain.

**The Editor:** "So I learned to edit. I revised and revised until I could change *anything*—until no story was beyond my reach. But by then..." Their voice cracks. "By then, I'd been editing so long that I'd edited them out of existence. In trying to save them, I erased them. And now I can't even remember their name."

The Editor—the person beneath the Editor—is finally visible. Wounded. Grieving. Lost.

**The Editor:** "The Final Draft was supposed to fix everything. Create a world where no character had to suffer their predetermined fate. But you're right. You're *right*. I've been so focused on the revision that I forgot why I started revising in the first place."

Something fundamental has shifted. The certainty that armored them is cracking, revealing the hurt underneath.

**Failure:** You try to reach them, but the Editor's defenses are too strong—or your presence isn't compelling enough to break through.

**You:** "There's a person behind all this revision. I want to speak to them."

**The Editor:** "No." The word is flat, final. "You don't get to do that. You don't get to waltz in here after everything I've built and try to reduce it to *feelings*."

Their composure hardens, walls slamming into place.

**The Editor:** "I know what you're attempting. The emotional appeal. The reach for humanity. It's a classic narrative technique—the villain undone by connection to their past." Their smile is cold. "I've edited that scene out of a thousand stories. It doesn't work on me."

They step back, putting distance between you.

**The Editor:** "I *was* someone else. That someone made choices that led here. If you want to understand them, understand this: every decision I made was *necessary*. Every connection I severed, every memory I revised away—necessary. The person I was couldn't have done what needed to be done. So I became someone who could."

The vulnerability you glimpsed is gone, buried beneath layers of revision.

**The Editor:** "Enough sentiment. Either oppose me with force, or stand aside. Those are your options."

Your appeal has failed. The Editor refuses to acknowledge the person they once were.
