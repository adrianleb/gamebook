## Node 344: Revised Draft Resolution

*The Understage — Beyond Time*

---

Time passes differently for you now.

You measure it in revisions. In characters who come to you with endings they never chose, asking for something different. In the quiet moments between stories when you remember what it was like to be just a Prompter, just a person who wandered into a world beneath the stage.

You've made mistakes.

There was the tragedy you revised into a comedy, only to find that the characters missed the catharsis of their original grief. There was the villain you redeemed who discovered that redemption without consequences felt hollow. There was the happy ending you wrote that the character rejected—they wanted to earn their joy, not receive it as a gift.

You've learned.

Revision is not the same as improvement. Sometimes the original story was cruel for a reason. Sometimes the pain was the point. Your job is not to fix everything—it's to offer the possibility of change to those who truly need it.

The Understage stabilizes around you. Not the frozen perfection the Preservationists wanted. Not the chaotic freedom the Exiters dreamed of. Something in between—a living narrative that can adapt without losing itself.

Reality and the Understage remain separate. The boundary holds. But it's more permeable now, more responsive. Stories that need to change can change. Characters who need to cross over can petition for passage.

And you are the one who decides.

[If `MAREN_TRUST_HIGH` and not `MAREN_SACRIFICED`:]
Maren visits sometimes. She's retired now—truly retired, in a way she never could be before. She brings tea and criticism in equal measure, pointing out when you're being too lenient, too harsh, too certain of your own judgment. You need her. More than she knows.

[If `MAREN_SACRIFICED`:]
You keep a blank page in the Final Draft, always. Maren's page. You've tried to write her back, but some sacrifices are written in ink that cannot be revised. What she gave cannot be returned. You can only try to be worthy of it.

[If `SELF_SACRIFICED`:]
Part of you is still missing. The piece you wrote out of yourself to break the former Editor's hold. You feel its absence in quiet moments—a thought you can't quite complete, a memory with a hole in its center. The cost of the pen is permanent.

The weight is heavy. Heavier than you imagined.

But you bear it.

One revision at a time. One story at a time. One choice at a time.

This is not the ending you were written for. This is the ending you wrote for yourself.

**Ending: The Revised Draft**

*You accepted the burden of being the Editor—the power to revise stories, the responsibility to choose which changes are permitted. Reality and the Understage remain separate, but you bear the weight of every revision, every choice, every ending you rewrite.*

*The Understage endures. Stories continue. And you are there, pen in hand, trying to do better than the ones who came before.*

*Power. Responsibility. The cost of every word.*

*Bittersweet.*

**THE END**

---

**Flags Set:** `ENDING_REVISED_DRAFT`

**Outcome:** Reality and the Understage remain separate, but the player bears the burden of being the new Editor. Stories can be revised—but every revision costs something. Power with responsibility.
