## Node 347: A World Rewritten

*Between Worlds — The New Threshold*

Reality adapts. Fiction adapts. You watch it happen in real time—two worlds that were never meant to touch learning how to coexist.

It's not smooth. It's not easy.

The first week, there are incidents. A dragon appears over a city, confused and frightened, until characters from its own story coax it back into narrative space. A child walks into their favorite fairy tale and is nearly lost until other characters guide them home. The line between dreams and waking life blurs, and some people struggle to tell which is which.

But humans are adaptable. Stories are resilient.

New rules emerge. Not laws—nothing so rigid—but understandings. Protocols. Ways of navigating between worlds that develop organically as everyone learns the new landscape.

And you?

**The Editor:** "You can't stay in one place anymore." The former Editor stands beside you at the threshold—the permanent doorway where the Mainstage once was. "The boundary is gone, but someone still needs to tend the crossing. Someone who understands both sides."

**You:** "A Bridge-Keeper."

**The Editor:** "If you want to call it that." They look at the stream of beings passing through—characters becoming real, real people entering stories, the endless flow of narrative and reality intermingling. "I couldn't have done this. Couldn't have imagined doing this. I spent so long maintaining separation that I forgot why the connection matters."

[If `STAGEHAND_CURIOUS`:]
The Stagehand finds you between crossings. They're different now—clearer, more present. "The Stagehand remembers everything," they say. "Being cut from a story, losing themselves in the space between. But now there is no between. There's only... everywhere." They smile, and it reaches their eyes for the first time you've seen. "The Stagehand thinks they'd like to find their original story. See if it misses them."

[If `UNDERSTUDY_PARTNER`:]
The Understudy approaches, their form shifting subtly. "I was a replacement," they say. "A copy to fill gaps in stories. But if the boundary is gone—if characters can cross freely—then replacements aren't needed anymore. So what am I?" They pause. "I suppose I get to find out. That's strange. That's wonderful."

[If `FINAL_GIRL_TRUST`:]
The Final Girl pauses at the threshold, looking back at you. "In the stories, survival was the goal. Stay alive, make it to the credits, that was winning." She takes a breath of real air. "But this isn't about survival. This is about *living*. I don't know how to do that yet." A thin smile. "Guess I'll have to learn."

[If `SOLVED_CASE_PARTNER`:]
The Solved Case tips their hat to you from across the threshold. "Justice looks different now," they say. "When anyone can walk between worlds, when characters have real lives... the cases are going to get complicated." Their eyes gleam. "I can't wait."

Not everyone is happy. You see characters who preferred the certainty of their stories, who found the infinite possibility of reality overwhelming. You see people who entered fiction and lost themselves in narratives that consumed them. Freedom has costs. Chaos has victims.

But more find joy than sorrow. More find wonder than fear.

The worlds are learning to dance together.
