## Node 300: The Mainstage Arrival

*The Mainstage — Center of the Understage*

You emerge from the Archives into vastness.

The Mainstage reveals itself not in parts but all at once—an assault of scale that makes the Archives feel like a closet. The stage stretches in every direction, its boards worn smooth by a million performances that never happened and a million more that did. Above, the proscenium arch climbs toward a darkness that might be ceiling or might be sky, its gilded edges catching light from sources you can't identify.

The wings stretch into shadow on either side. Between them, you see the fly system—ropes and pulleys and counterweights suspending narrative threads like a cat's cradle of story. Half-written scenes drift in the air, pages falling like snow that never quite reaches the ground. Ink bleeds between realities here, pooling in footlight troughs that glow with words instead of flame.

And the audience. The seats stretch backward into infinite darkness, row upon row of empty velvet that somehow feels *occupied*. Something watches from that darkness. Something has always been watching.

At center stage, you see it: the Editor's work. A desk of impossible size, its surface covered with manuscripts that rewrite themselves. The Final Draft pulses at its heart—a massive document that breathes with narrative power. You can feel it from here, pulling at the edges of your own story.

The Understudy stands beside you, their hand finding yours in the darkness. Whether comfort or terror drives the touch, you can't tell.

**The Understudy:** "We made it. We actually—" They stop, their gaze fixed on the Editor's desk. "That's it, isn't it? The Final Draft. Everything we learned in the Archives... it's all leading there."

CHORUS echoes from somewhere in the wings, their collective voice muted by distance and awe: "—the Prompter has arrived—" "—finally, finally—" "—we've waited so long—" "—the last act begins—"

The stage feels like a held breath. Like the moment before the curtain rises. Like the pause between "once upon a time" and everything that follows.

You have three immediate options: survey the space before committing to an approach, seek out whatever allies have followed you here, or stride directly toward that distant desk where your enemy waits.
