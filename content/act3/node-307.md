## Node 307: The Wings

*The Mainstage — Stage Right Wings*

The wings offer shadow and the thin comfort of concealment.

You press yourself against the nearest flat—a painted forest scene from some forgotten fairy tale—and peer around its edge toward Center Stage. For the first time since entering the Understage, you see the Editor clearly.

They sit at a desk that shouldn't exist. Not a prop desk, painted and hollow, but something *real*—dark wood, heavy and permanent, covered in papers and ink bottles and the accumulated debris of endless revision. The desk exists in multiple states simultaneously: ancient and new, pristine and ink-stained, solid and somehow translucent.

And on the desk, the Final Draft.

You've heard about it. Every character you've met has spoken of it with fear or longing or hope. But seeing it is different. The manuscript pulses like a living thing, pages turning on their own, ink shifting and reforming. It's not just a document—it's a *process*, reality being rewritten in real time. You watch words appear, vanish, reappear changed. Whole paragraphs shuffle and reassemble.

The Editor writes. Their pen moves with terrible certainty, adding to the Draft. With each stroke, you feel the Understage *adjust*. The lighting shifts. The air pressure changes. Somewhere in the distance, a story ends and another begins.

This is what you came to stop. Or negotiate. Or understand.

But first: approach without warning, or let them set the scene?

**[STAT CHECK: Improv 2]**

**Success:** You control your breathing. You become still—not just physically still, but *narratively* still. A background character. A piece of scenery. Your Improv training lets you slip out of the story's focus, becoming temporarily irrelevant to the narrative the Editor is writing.

They continue their work, unaware. You have time to study them, to prepare, to choose your moment of entry. When you step out, it will be on your terms.

**Failure:** The pen stops.

The Editor doesn't look up—not immediately. But their hand hovers, and you feel something change in the air. The Draft flutters, its pages rustling though there's no wind.

**The Editor:** "You've come far."

The words aren't directed at you—not yet. They're written on the page in front of them, appearing as the Editor speaks. A line of dialogue, freshly inked. Your arrival, scripted.

**The Editor:** "Most give up in the Archives. Or the Green Room distracts them." Now they look up, and their eyes find yours with no hesitation. They knew exactly where you were. "But you. You've followed the story to its source."

They cap their pen. Stand. The Final Draft continues writing itself behind them.

**The Editor:** "Let's see how your story ends."
