## Node 305: Approach Selection

*The Mainstage — Wings (Decision Point)*

The moment settles around you like a held breath.

Your allies—those who are here—wait for your decision. The Understudy's notes lie spread across the prop table, four paths marked in different colored inks: Preservationist blue, Revisionist red, Exiter green, Independent purple. Each represents not just a tactical choice but a statement about who you've become across this journey.

The Mainstage hums with possibility. The Editor works at their desk, unaware—or pretending to be unaware—of the council happening in the wings. The Final Draft continues its endless self-revision, each page a reality waiting to be imposed.

You must choose. Not which path is "right"—all paths lead to the Editor—but which path is *yours*.

**The Understudy:** "Whatever you decide, I'm with you. All of us are." They glance at the gathered allies. "This is what you've been building toward. Every choice from the Prompter's Booth to now has shaped this moment."

They hand you the annotated manuscript—your journey reduced to flags and relationships, decisions and consequences. You see your own story laid bare in scholarly notation.

**The Understudy:** "Your choices don't lie. Neither should your approach."

**Choices:**

1. *[Preservationist approach]* Take the measured path through Center Stage—contain the threat, preserve the balance → Node 306
   *For those who believe stories should end as written, justice served, order maintained.*

2. *[Revisionist approach]* Descend to the Orchestra Pit—seek control of narrative's rhythm, find leverage for negotiation → Node 310
   *For those who believe stories can be changed, improved, given better endings.*

3. *[Exiter approach]* Climb the Fly System—gain perspective, then challenge the entire structure → Node 314
   *For those who believe characters deserve freedom, even if it means chaos.*

4. *[Bold approach]* Stride directly to confrontation—the Editor has waited long enough → Node 322
   *For those who are done waiting. Direct action. Whatever the cost.*

**Narrative Note:**
This choice reflects your dominant faction alignment but does not lock you into a single ending. The path you take shapes the confrontation's opening conditions, but the Editor will respond to *you*—to everything you've done, everyone you've helped, every choice that brought you here. The ending is still unwritten.

Your allies will support your choice, though some may question approaches that conflict with their nature. This is your story. They're here to help you tell it.
