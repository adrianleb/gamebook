## Node 301: Survey the Mainstage

*The Mainstage — Wings*

You move toward the wings, seeking perspective before commitment.

From here, the Mainstage's geography becomes clearer—though "clear" feels like the wrong word for a space that refuses to behave. The stage has distinct regions, each offering different tactical possibilities for what comes next.

**Center Stage** dominates your view. The Editor's desk sits there like a throne, manuscripts piled high, the Final Draft glowing at its heart. The approach is direct but exposed. Anyone walking that path would be seen long before they arrived. Stage directions float in the air around it—literally visible instructions that might help or hinder.

**The Orchestra Pit** lies below the stage's lip, a sunken area where shadows pool thicker than elsewhere. You glimpse instruments down there, but they're wrong—a violin strung with narrative threads, drums made from bound manuscripts, a conductor's stand holding a score written in languages that shift as you watch. The "music" that emerges from the pit doesn't reach your ears so much as your understanding. This is where story rhythm originates.

**The Fly System** rises above, an intricate maze of ropes, pulleys, and counterweights. But instead of sandbags and backdrops, the system suspends story elements—scenes, chapters, entire character arcs hanging in narrative limbo. From up there, you could see the stage's true structure. You might also fall into someone else's story entirely.

**The Audience** sits in darkness behind you. Rows of seats stretch backward into infinite shadow. You sense rather than see the watchers—everyone who has ever experienced a story, their expectations pressing against the stage like weather. Meeting their gaze feels like the ultimate test. Or the ultimate mistake.

The Understudy studies each area with academic intensity, their researcher's instincts cataloging possibilities.

**The Understudy:** "Four paths. The Center is the obvious choice—and therefore the dangerous one. The Pit controls tone. The Fly System controls perspective. And the Audience..." They shudder. "The Audience controls *judgment*."

They look at you, waiting.

**The Understudy:** "Where do we start?"
