## Node 328: Action: Opposing

*The Mainstage — Center Stage*

Words have failed—or perhaps you never believed they would succeed. The Editor's philosophy, their methods, their vision for the Final Draft—none of it matters if they're allowed to finish what they started.

It's time to act.

The stage shifts beneath your feet as you make your decision. The Final Draft pulses with anticipatory energy, pages rustling as if sensing the confrontation to come. The Editor watches you with eyes that have seen this moment coming since you first stepped onto the Mainstage.

**The Editor:** "So. Direct opposition." There's neither surprise nor disappointment in their voice—only a kind of weary acknowledgment. "I suppose it was always going to come to this."

They raise one hand, and the narrative around you *flexes*. Stage directions appear in the air, trying to write you into a scene you didn't choose. Character notes attempt to impose themselves on your thoughts, suggesting motivations that aren't yours.

The Editor isn't just powerful—they're fighting on home ground. The Mainstage responds to their will.

But you're a Prompter. You've navigated the liminal spaces between stories all your career. You know how to resist being written.

**[APPROACH CHECK: Script 3 OR Stage Presence 3 OR Improv 3]**

*Choose your approach to opposing the Editor:*

---

**Script Approach (Script 3):** You counter their narrative control with narrative understanding. Every story has rules. Every author has patterns. You've seen enough of the Editor's work to recognize their techniques—and to subvert them.

**Success:** The stage directions the Editor writes begin to unravel as you speak counter-narratives, your understanding of story structure providing the leverage to resist their rewrites.

**Failure:** Your counter-narrative falters; the Editor's mastery of script exceeds yours, and their revisions begin to take hold.

---

**Stage Presence Approach (Stage Presence 3):** You assert yourself against the Editor's attempt to control the scene. This is *your* moment, not theirs. The Mainstage may respond to the Editor, but you've performed under worse conditions.

**Success:** Your presence fills the stage, pushing back against the Editor's control. For a moment, you're the protagonist here, not them—and the narrative bends to acknowledge it.

**Failure:** The Editor's stage presence overwhelms yours; they've been commanding this space for longer than you've been a Prompter.

---

**Improv Approach (Improv 3):** You refuse to fight on the Editor's terms. They're expecting opposition—so you improvise, making moves they can't anticipate, disrupting their control through sheer unpredictability.

**Success:** Your unscripted actions throw the Editor off balance. They've planned for resistance, but not for chaos. Their grip on the Mainstage wavers.

**Failure:** The Editor adapts faster than you can improvise; their experience encompasses every unexpected move you might make.

---

**On Any Success:**

The Editor staggers back as your resistance proves stronger than expected. The Final Draft's pages scatter, its cohesion disrupted. For the first time since you entered the Mainstage, you see uncertainty in the Editor's eyes.

**The Editor:** "You're stronger than I anticipated." They regroup, but the initiative has shifted. "Maren trained you well. Perhaps too well."

The stage is contested now. Neither of you has full control. The Final Draft hovers between you, incomplete and vulnerable.

**The Editor:** "But strength alone won't be enough. I've been writing this confrontation for years. Every move you make, I've already drafted."

They haven't given up—but you've proven you can fight them.

**On Any Failure:**

The Editor's power washes over you, their narrative control proving stronger than your resistance. Stage directions write themselves around you—*The protagonist hesitates. Doubt creeps into their eyes.*—and you feel yourself beginning to conform to what's being written.

**The Editor:** "I didn't want this." Their voice carries genuine regret. "You could have cooperated. You could have trusted my vision. Instead..."

The Final Draft's pages swirl around you, each one carrying words that try to define you, limit you, reduce you to a character in their story.

**The Editor:** "...instead, I must write you into a role you didn't choose. I take no pleasure in it, but the Draft must be completed."

You've lost the advantage. The Editor's control over the Mainstage is tightening.
