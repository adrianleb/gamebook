## Node 308: Story Fragment Encounter

*The Mainstage — Edited Space*

The fragment catches you.

It's not a physical grip—nothing in the Understage is ever quite physical—but the unfinished scene wraps around you like a memory you can't shake. One moment you're navigating the edited detritus of Center Stage; the next, you're standing in someone else's story.

The scene that traps you isn't random. Of course it isn't. The Understage remembers every choice you've made, every character you've touched, every narrative you've altered on your journey from the Prompter's Booth to here. The fragment that manifests is one you *affected*.

**If `RUNAWAY_ALLIED`:** The scene shows the Runaway before their escape—the pivotal moment when they first decided to flee their fairy tale. You see them younger, trapped in a tower window, looking at a world they were never written to join. They don't see you. They're rehearsing a decision that, in part because of your help, they were finally able to make.

**If `PAWN_ALLIED`:** The fragment replays the Prophecy's Pawn receiving their destiny—the moment a minor character learned they would define someone else's greatness. Their face holds the exact expression you remember: resignation masking hope, acceptance threaded with defiance. Because of you, that expression now means something different.

**If `UNDERSTUDY_PARTNER`:** You see the Understudy's first performance—not understudy work, but their one moment in the spotlight. The scene that got them noticed. The scene that got them edited. They're brilliant, heartbreaking, and the Editor's pen hovers just out of frame, ready to cut them down to supporting role forever.

**If none of the above:** A generic scene manifests: two characters you don't recognize, saying goodbye. Their farewell has the shape of every farewell in every story—parent and child, lover and beloved, friend and friend. It doesn't matter which. What matters is that you're here, interrupting their eternal moment.

The fragment turns toward you. Not with hostility—these aren't antagonists. They're *unfinished*. They ache with the need for resolution, for acknowledgment, for someone to see what they were before the Editor's revision took hold.

**Fragment Voice:** "You're here. You're really here. We've been waiting... for someone who could *see* us..."

They reach for you. Not to attack. To connect. To be witnessed.

But you can't stay. The Editor's work continues. Every moment spent with ghosts is a moment the Final Draft writes itself further toward completion.

**[APPROACH CHECK: Script 2 OR Stage Presence 2]**

**Success (Script):** You recognize this scene. Not the specifics, but the *structure*—you've read enough scripts to know a flashback when you're standing in one. With careful words, you acknowledge the fragment without becoming part of it. You name what you see: the choice they faced, the person they became, the story that was taken from them.

It's enough. The fragment settles, not resolved but *witnessed*. They release you, fading back into the edited margins of the stage.

**Success (Stage Presence):** You meet their eyes. You don't look away. Stage Presence isn't just about commanding attention—it's about being *present*, truly present, even when presence is painful. You let the fragment see you seeing them.

For a moment, you share their unfinished grief. Then you step back, firmly, with the gravity of someone who has their own story to complete.

They understand. Performers always understand an exit cue.

**Failure:** The fragment holds you too long. Their need is a weight you can't shake off. Their story pours into yours—fragmented memories, cut dialogue, the echo of scenes that never quite resolved.

By the time you pull free, the Mainstage has shifted. The Editor's awareness has brushed against this moment. They know you're coming now. Perhaps they always knew—but now they're *prepared*.

You stagger back toward the safer territory of the approach, shaking off residual narrative, trying to find your own story again.
