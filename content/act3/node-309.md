## Node 309: Dramatic Entrance

*The Mainstage — Center Stage Threshold*

You've watched. You've prepared. You've navigated the narrative interference and slipped past the ghosts of edited stories. The wings have sheltered you long enough.

It's time to make an entrance.

You step out of the shadows and onto Center Stage.

The moment you cross the threshold, the Mainstage *responds*. This is the heart of the Understage, where performance is reality—and reality is always, inevitably, performance. Every entrance here is a statement. Every movement is choreography. Every word carries the weight of a thousand opening lines.

The lights shift.

Not metaphorically. Actual theatrical lighting pivots in the infinite darkness above, swinging to catch you in a spotlight you didn't request. The circle of illumination pools around your feet, marking you as the protagonist—or perhaps the antagonist—of whatever scene is about to unfold.

The endless audience stirs in their eternal seats. You feel their attention like a physical pressure, countless watchers leaning forward to witness what happens next.

And at the desk, the Editor stops writing.

*[Variable tone based on dominant faction alignment]*

**If Preservationist-aligned:** The Editor's expression is almost... respectful. They set down their pen with the care of someone closing a book they've enjoyed.

**The Editor:** "A Preservationist. One who believes in endings as written, in stories that know their shape." They stand slowly, moving like someone aware of their own dramatic weight. "I had hoped you might understand. Perhaps you still will."

**If Revisionist-aligned:** The Editor's lips curve into something between a smile and a grimace. Recognition. Kinship, even.

**The Editor:** "A Revisionist. Someone who knows that stories can change—*should* change—when the telling fails the tale." They push back from the desk. "We're not so different, you and I. The question is whose revisions prevail."

**If Exiter-aligned:** The Editor's face hardens. Not with anger—with something closer to disappointment.

**The Editor:** "An Exiter. One who would free the characters from their stories, regardless of consequence." They rise, and the Final Draft flutters restlessly behind them. "You call it liberation. I call it murder. Stories *need* their shapes to survive."

**If Independent/Mixed:** The Editor regards you with something like curiosity. An unreadable expression for an unreadable path.

**The Editor:** "Neither adherent nor rebel. Someone who makes their own choices, outside faction lines." They step around the desk, moving toward you with careful precision. "That makes you either the most reasonable person I've met... or the most dangerous."

The moment stretches. Center Stage holds its breath.

You've made your entrance. Now the scene truly begins.

**The Editor:** "So. You've come to the heart of it. The place where all stories converge, where every narrative thread leads eventually." They gesture at the Final Draft, still writing itself on the desk behind them. "You've seen what I'm doing. You've heard the rumors, the fears, the accusations. Now you're here to—what? Stop me? Understand me? Join me?"

They wait. The spotlight holds you both. The audience watches.

**The Editor:** "Tell me, Prompter: how does *your* story end?"
