## Node 304: Strategy Session

*The Mainstage — Wings (Council Circle)*

You gather your allies in a loose circle, using a pool of shadow in the wings as cover from the Editor's notice. The Understudy produces their annotated manuscript, spreading notes across a prop table that may or may not have existed a moment ago.

**The Understudy:** "We need a plan. The Editor's been working toward this for longer than any of us have been aware. We can't just... improvise against that."

Your allies exchange glances. Each carries their own perspective, shaped by their genre, their faction alignment, and what they've lost to the Editor's revisions.

**[ALLY COUNCIL]**

*Each present ally offers advice reflecting their nature:*

---

*[If `MAREN_TRUST_HIGH`]*
**Maren** speaks first, her voice carrying the weight of decades.

**Maren:** "The Editor was like me once. A Prompter. Maybe the first Prompter. They believe they're saving stories by rewriting them." She pauses. "Containment is possible. If we can separate them from the Final Draft, cut the connection—they lose the power to rewrite. But we'd need to trap them *within* a story. Permanently."

*Preservationist strategy: Contain the Editor. End the threat without destroying them.*

---

*[If `SOLVED_CASE_PARTNER`]*
**The Solved Case** produces a worn notebook, pages covered in their cramped observations.

**The Solved Case:** "I've been tracking the Editor's patterns. They edit in phases—observation, judgment, revision, execution. Interrupt any phase, the whole process stalls. The Final Draft is their tool, but it's also their weakness. Destroy the Draft, destroy their power."

*Preservationist strategy: Target the Final Draft directly.*

---

*[If `HAPPY_ENDING_FRIEND`]*
**The Happy Ending's** gentle voice cuts through the tactical discussion.

**The Happy Ending:** "The Editor was a person once. They made choices that led here, but choices can be unmade. If we could reach the person inside—remind them why stories matter, why endings matter—perhaps we could convince them to stop. Perhaps the Final Draft doesn't need to be destroyed. Perhaps it needs to be *completed*... differently."

*Revisionist strategy: Negotiate with the Editor. Offer an alternative ending.*

---

*[If `PAWN_ALLIED`]*
**The Prophecy's Pawn** paces, their heroic instincts warring with their learned cynicism.

**The Pawn:** "I know what it's like to discover your whole existence was written by someone else. The Editor's trying to rewrite everyone. But what if we let them rewrite *themselves*? Turn their power inward. Make them see what they've become."

*Revisionist strategy: Use the Editor's own power against them.*

---

*[If `RUNAWAY_ALLIED`]*
**The Runaway** speaks with quiet intensity.

**The Runaway:** "The Editor believes they're freeing stories by editing them. But freedom isn't something you impose. It's something you allow." They gesture toward the distant Audience. "Those watchers—they're part of this. Stories exist because they're witnessed. If we could somehow... break the stage itself. Let the stories and the Audience become the same thing."

*Exiter strategy: Dissolve the boundary. End the hierarchy.*

---

*[If `QUEST_ALLY`]*
**The Unfinished Quest** grins with battle-ready energy.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "My story never got a proper final battle. This is my chance. I say we hit the Editor directly—make it a contest of narrative will. Who has more right to determine how stories end: the one who writes them, or the ones who live them?"

*Exiter strategy: Direct confrontation. Challenge the Editor's authority.*

---

*[If `FINAL_GIRL_TRUST`]*
**The Final Girl** scans the darkness with practiced wariness.

**The Final Girl:** "I've survived three acts of horror. You know what I learned? The monster is never just a monster. There's always something behind it. Something that made it." She looks toward the Audience. "The Editor's responding to something. Find out what, and maybe we don't have to fight them at all."

*Independent strategy: Seek the deeper truth. The Editor may not be the real enemy.*

---

*[If `STAGEHAND_CURIOUS`]*
**The Stagehand** speaks hesitantly, reaching for memories that keep slipping away.

**The Stagehand:** "The Stagehand... knows the Editor. Knew them. Before. The Editor made choices. The Editor lost something." They touch their own chest. "The Editor made the Stagehand. Maybe. The Stagehand doesn't remember. But..." Their voice gains unexpected clarity. "The Editor regrets. The Editor always regrets."

*Independent insight: The Editor's personal cost. There may be a vulnerability.*

---

*[If `PAGES_BEFRIENDED`]*
**The Lost Pages** flutter nervously.

**Lost Pages:** "We were stories. We were cut. We know what it's like to be edited. The Editor—the Editor doesn't want to cut. The Editor has to. Something makes them. Something worse." Their fragments align momentarily. "The Blank Page. The nothing that comes before words. The Editor is running from it. Running by writing."

*Independent insight: An external threat. The Editor may be protecting something.*

---

The Understudy organizes the suggestions, their scholarly instincts making order from chaos.

**The Understudy:** "So. We have containment. Negotiation. Confrontation. And investigation." They look at you. "Your choice, Prompter. What approach speaks to you? What have your choices across this whole journey been building toward?"

---

**Choices:**

1. Choose your approach—commit to a strategy based on your journey's arc → Node 305
2. We need more information first—survey the stage before committing → Node 301
