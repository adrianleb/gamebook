## Node 316: Tactical Descent

*The Mainstage — Precision Approach*

You descend with purpose.

Where others would simply drop from the fly system to the stage below, you navigate. The structural insight burns in your mind like a map—not of geography, but of *narrative vulnerability*. You know exactly where the Editor's control is weakest, where the transitions between drafts create opportunities.

You land at a junction point—a place where the original Understage meets the Editor's revised reality. Here, the floorboards don't quite align. The lighting angles contradict. Two versions of the stage exist in the same space, and you're standing in the overlap.

The Editor hasn't noticed you yet. Or perhaps they have, but your position confuses them—you're not quite *in* their manuscript, not quite outside it. You exist in the margins, in the space between what was written and what will be.

{IF ALLIES_PRESENT}
Your allies are still below, waiting for your signal. From here, you can guide them to similar junction points—places where the Editor's control thins, where their characters might resist being edited.

You gesture. The Stagehand, the Runaway, whoever came with you—they move to positions you indicate. They don't understand why, exactly, but they trust your certainty. When the confrontation begins, you won't face the Editor alone. You'll face them from positions of structural advantage, from the seams in their own draft.

**The Editor's first move will be less effective. You've read their stage before they could revise you.**
{ELSE}
Even alone, your position gives you leverage. The Editor controls the manuscript, but you've found where manuscript meets reality. You can't be easily written out from here—you're in the story's blind spot.

When the confrontation begins, you'll have a moment of advantage. A chance to speak, to act, before the Editor can bring their full power to bear. It might not be much. But in a battle of narratives, a single moment of surprise can change everything.
{ENDIF}

The Editor waits at Center Stage, focused on the Final Draft. They haven't turned yet. They don't know what you've learned, what position you've taken.

But they will. The confrontation is about to begin.
