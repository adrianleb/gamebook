## Node 303: Direct Approach

*The Mainstage — Center Stage Approach*

No more preparation. No more waiting. The Editor is there, the Final Draft is there, and you've come too far for caution.

You step onto Center Stage.

The boards groan beneath your feet—not with age, but with recognition. Stage directions materialize in the air around you, glowing text that tries to script your movement: *[Enter PROTAGONIST, stage left, uncertain]* *[PROTAGONIST hesitates, showing fear]* *[PROTAGONIST considers retreat]*

You push through them. The words shatter like glass, reforming behind you into new instructions you refuse to follow.

The Editor's desk looms larger with each step. The Final Draft pulses with anticipation—or hunger. The manuscripts scattered across the desk ruffle in a wind that doesn't exist, pages turning to reveal glimpses of rewrites-in-progress. You see fragments: a hero unmade, a love story inverted, an ending that erases the story that preceded it.

The distance between you and the desk shouldn't be this long. You've been walking for what feels like minutes. The stage stretches, resisting your approach, trying to give the Editor time to—

**"Ah."**

The voice comes from everywhere and nowhere. Calm. Almost gentle. Absolutely certain.

**"You've chosen the bold entrance. That tells me something about how this draft is developing."**

**[STAT CHECK: Stage Presence 3]**

*You need presence—raw theatrical force—to command this stage before the Editor commands you.*

**Success (Stage Presence 3+):**

You plant your feet. The stage stops stretching. The floating directions burn away in the heat of your refusal to follow them.

**You:** "I didn't come here to follow your script."

The silence that follows has weight. Then, from somewhere near the desk, you hear something unexpected: a laugh. Not mocking—impressed.

**The Editor:** "No. I can see that now. You've been rewriting yourself since you started. How... *interesting*."

The distance between you and the desk compresses. One moment you're twenty feet away; the next, you're standing at its edge, the Final Draft spread before you like a challenge.

The Editor turns.

**Failure (Stage Presence below 3):**

The stage directions wrap around you like vines. *[PROTAGONIST falters]* *[PROTAGONIST's confidence wavers]* *[PROTAGONIST is not the hero of this story]*

You fight them, but each step becomes harder. The Editor's will presses against yours, and you feel yourself being cast—assigned a role you didn't choose.

**The Editor:** "Bold. But not bold enough. Not yet."

The stage shifts beneath you. When your vision clears, you're no longer on the direct path to Center Stage. You've been deflected—pushed toward the wings, toward the safer route.

You'll have to approach more carefully. The direct path is closed until you're stronger.
