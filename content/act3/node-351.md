## Node 351: Closed Canon Resolution

*Reality — The World You Saved*

Time passes.

At first, you don't notice the change. Reality was always solid, always certain—that's why you chose to protect it. But slowly, you begin to sense the absence. The world feels *smaller* now. Not worse, necessarily. Just... less.

You walk through a library and realize the books on the shelves are just books. No doorways to other worlds. No characters waiting to step off the page. The stories end where they're supposed to end, and nothing escapes the binding.

A child asks you about fairy tales. You tell them the stories, but something in your voice makes them frown.

"They're not real, are they?" the child asks.

"No," you say. "They're not real."

And that's the truth now. The only truth.

**[If `MAREN_TRUST_HIGH` and not `MAREN_SACRIFICED`:]**
Maren adjusts to the real world slowly. She'd spent so long as a bridge between realities that being anchored to just one feels like learning to walk with only one leg.

"Do you regret it?" she asks one evening.

You think about the characters you knew. The stories you walked through. The wonder you'll never experience again.

"Sometimes," you admit.

"Me too." She takes your hand. "But I'd rather be here. With you. In a world that's *safe*, even if it's smaller."

Some nights you catch her staring at bookshelves, at theater marquees, at anything that hints at stories beyond stories. But she always turns away.

She chose you. She chose this.

**[If `MAREN_SACRIFICED`:]**
There's a gap in your life where Maren used to be. You carry it like an old wound—healed but never forgotten.

Some nights you dream of her: still in the Understage, preserved in that last moment before the sacrifice. A permanent character in a story that no one will ever read again.

You hope she's at peace. You hope the ending you gave her was kind.

You'll never know.

**[If `SELF_SACRIFICED`:]**
You're different now. The part of yourself you wrote out of existence left a hollow that nothing quite fills. You function. You work. You even laugh sometimes.

But there's a gap in your soul where a story used to be.

Perhaps that's the price of safety. Perhaps it's fair.

Perhaps it doesn't matter either way.

---

Years become decades. The Understage fades from memory—first yours, then the world's. Children grow up without knowing what they've lost. Adults forget the time when fiction felt dangerously alive.

Stories become simpler. Predictable. *Safe*.

No more villains walking in real flesh. No more heroes sacrificing themselves outside their narratives. No more characters demanding agency beyond their pages.

No more wonder.

No more terror.

The world sleeps soundly, dreaming only ordinary dreams.

And you—the last Prompter, the one who closed the door—you remember. You remember the impossible theater beneath reality. You remember the characters who loved and feared and *lived* beyond their stories.

You remember choosing to end it.

---

Some nights, when the world is quiet and imagination feels like a distant country you once visited, you stand before a bookshelf and pull down a worn novel. A fairy tale. A noir mystery. A horror story.

You read the words. Just words now.

But sometimes—*sometimes*—you think you see something flicker at the corner of your vision. A curtain twitch. A shadow move.

Probably nothing. The doors are closed. The canon is sealed.

But part of you wonders: did you truly close every passage? Or did you just close your eyes to the ones that remained?

It doesn't matter. You made your choice.

The Understage is gone.

And the world is safe.

---

*Safe but melancholic. Protected but diminished.*

*You saved reality from the chaos of living stories.*

*But you wonder, sometimes, what was lost in the saving.*
