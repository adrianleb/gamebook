## Node 321: Reserved

*The Mainstage — The Audience Watches*

**[EXPANSION BUFFER]**

This node is reserved for potential additional Audience interaction content. Possible expansions:

- Extended Audience dialogue sequence
- Alternate approach for specific faction alignments
- Deeper exploration of the meta-narrative nature of The Audience
- Recovery path from severe failure states
- Special interaction for players with specific Act 1-2 flags

---

**Design Notes:**

The Audience represents the ultimate meta-narrative element: the awareness that all stories exist *for* an observer. This node space can expand the existential encounter if playtesting reveals:

1. The Stage Presence 4 Expert check is too binary (success/failure)
2. Players want more agency in how they approach The Audience
3. The thematic weight of facing story-consumers needs additional development
4. Specific ally combinations create interesting Audience dynamics

Current implementation (318-320) covers the core path. This buffer ensures room for iteration.

**Not Currently Playable**

This node has no active content and should not be reachable through normal play. If a player reaches this node, redirect to Node 301 (Survey the Mainstage) for path selection.
