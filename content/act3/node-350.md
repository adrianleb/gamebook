## Node 350: The Final Curtain

*The Mainstage — Center Stage*

Your hands close around the Final Draft. The manuscript screams—not in sound, but in sensation, every nerve in your body crying out as the stories within fight for survival. Characters you've never met flash through your mind: heroes mid-quest, lovers mid-confession, villains mid-redemption. All the narratives that will never cross over. All the potential that will be sealed away.

You tear the first page.

The Mainstage shudders. Somewhere in the distance, a door slams shut—the first of many.

You tear another. And another. With each ripping sound, you feel the passages closing. The cracks between worlds sealing over like wounds finally allowed to heal.

The Editor watches, neither helping nor hindering. "It's done then," they say. "Or nearly done."

Your allies gather around you—those who chose to follow you here, to the end of everything.

**[If `STAGEHAND_CURIOUS`:]**
The Stagehand approaches, their form already beginning to fade at the edges. "I always wondered where I came from," they say. "Now I'll never know. But maybe that's... maybe that's all right. Some mysteries are meant to stay mysteries."

They offer you a small, sad smile. "Take care of the real world. It needs good stagehands too."

**[If `SOLVED_CASE_PARTNER`:]**
The Solved Case tips their hat, cigarette smoke curling upward for the last time. "Every case closes eventually," they say. "Even this one. It's been... illuminating. Tell the real world their mysteries are worth solving." They're already fading. "And that the answers aren't always what you expect."

**[If `QUEST_ALLY`:]**
The Unfinished Quest stands tall, their quest finally given an ending—just not the one anyone expected. "I thought completion was the point," they say. "But maybe the journey was the story all along. I'm at peace with that. Go complete *your* quest."

**[If `FINAL_GIRL_TRUST`:]**
The Final Girl nods once, sharp and certain. "Survival," she says. "That's what this is. The hardest kind—choosing to lose something so something else can live." She meets your eyes. "Don't forget what you survived for."

**[If `HAPPY_ENDING_FRIEND`:]**
The Happy Ending's smile is bittersweet—the first complicated expression you've ever seen them wear. "Not every story gets a happy ending," they say softly. "But a safe ending... that's not nothing. That's not nothing at all." They fade with the words on their lips: "Be happy anyway. Choose it."

**[If `UNDERSTUDY_PARTNER`:]**
The Understudy mirrors your expression—grief, resolve, certainty. "I was always meant to replace someone," they say. "Now I know who. The version of you that believed stories and reality could coexist. They're gone now." They bow, formal and final. "But you remain. The original. The only one."

The Final Draft crumbles to ash in your hands.

**[If `MAREN_TRUST_HIGH` and not `MAREN_SACRIFICED`:]**
Maren stands at the edge of the closing passage, her form flickering between worlds. "I could stay," she says. "In the Understage. Become part of it forever."

She looks at you—really looks, the way she used to before everything changed.

"Or I could come with you. Leave this behind. Be... just a person, in the real world."

The passage is closing. There's only time for one answer.

"What do you want me to choose?"

And you realize: this is her choice, not yours. You can tell her what you want, but the decision is hers.

"Come with me," you say. Or perhaps: "Stay if you need to."

Either way, she smiles—the first genuine smile since before the Editor's shadow fell over everything.

"I choose *you*," she says. "Whatever that means. Wherever that leads."

She steps through just as the last door closes.

**[If `MAREN_SACRIFICED`:]**
Maren isn't here for goodbyes. She's already given everything. The empty space where she should be standing is the price of this ending—and you'll carry it forever.

The final page dissolves. The Mainstage goes dark.

---

You're falling—no, you're *rising*. The Understage releases you like a held breath finally exhaled. Reality wraps around you, solid and certain and *limited* in ways the Understage never was.

Behind you, the last door closes. The final curtain falls.

There is no going back.
