## Node 302: Ally Reunion

*The Mainstage — Wings*

You turn from the stage itself to see who has followed you here.

The wings fill with arrivals—not all at once, but in clusters, each emergence carrying its own weight. Some step from the shadows with confidence. Others flicker into existence like half-remembered scenes. Each ally who appears is a thread you wove across two acts of choices. Each absence is a thread you cut or never tied.

**[REUNION CHECK]**

*The following allies appear based on your accumulated relationship flags:*

---

*[If `MAREN_TRUST_HIGH`]*
**Maren** emerges first, her presence commanding attention even in this impossible space. She looks older than when you last saw her—or perhaps just more honest about her age. Her theatrical precision is gone, replaced by something rawer.

**Maren:** "I told myself I'd let you handle this alone. That you were ready." She manages a tired smile. "I've never been good at following my own stage directions."

---

*[If `STAGEHAND_CURIOUS`]*
**The Stagehand** appears from somewhere that wasn't there a moment ago, carrying a battered toolbox that seems heavier than before.

**The Stagehand:** "The Stagehand... remembers this place. Remembers it wrong. The Stagehand worked here once. Before they forgot." They look toward Center Stage with an expression you've never seen on their simple face. "The Editor knows the Stagehand. The Stagehand knows... something."

---

*[If `RUNAWAY_ALLIED`]*
**The Runaway** slips through the curtains, their tragic poetry stilled for once.

**The Runaway:** "You gave me a chance to rewrite my ending. I want to see you rewrite yours."

---

*[If `PAWN_ALLIED`]*
**The Prophecy's Pawn** strides in with the bearing of a hero they've rejected.

**The Pawn:** "I spent my whole story being told what to do. This time, I choose. I choose *you*."

---

*[If `SOLVED_CASE_PARTNER`]*
**The Solved Case** arrives with their usual clipped efficiency, coat collar turned up against cold that isn't there.

**The Solved Case:** "I've been tracking the Editor for a long time. This is where the trail ends. Whatever's in those manuscripts—that's the answer to every question I've been asking."

---

*[If `QUEST_ALLY`]*
**The Unfinished Quest** bursts through with barely contained energy.

**The Unfinished Quest:** "Finally! A proper final confrontation! I've waited my whole story for this moment—then escaped before I got it. Now I get to earn my ending."

---

*[If `FINAL_GIRL_TRUST`]*
**The Final Girl** emerges from shadows, moving with practiced wariness.

**The Final Girl:** "Survived three acts of terror. Survived the escape. Survived the Understage." She checks the exits with automatic precision. "Let's survive this too."

---

*[If `HAPPY_ENDING_FRIEND`]*
**The Happy Ending** floats in with their characteristic gentle warmth, though their edges seem frayed.

**The Happy Ending:** "I don't know if there's a happy ending here. But if there is, I want to help you find it. Even if... even if it's not the kind of happiness I understand."

---

*[If `UNDERSTUDY_PARTNER`]*
**The Understudy** is already beside you—they never left. But their presence feels more solid now, more committed.

**The Understudy:** "I've been your partner since the Archives. I'm not stopping now. Whatever we find out about the Editor... we find it together."

---

*[If `PAGES_BEFRIENDED`]*
**The Lost Pages** flutter in—literally, their fragmentary forms drifting like autumn leaves.

**Lost Pages:** "We came. We think we came. Yes—we're here. Or pieces of us. The important pieces. The pieces that remember what the Editor cut."

---

*[If significant CHORUS interactions]*
**CHORUS** ripples through the wings, their collective presence spreading like murmured gossip.

**CHORUS:** "—we're here—" "—all of us, the unimportant ones—" "—the ones nobody writes epilogues for—" "—we remember everything that happens in the margins—" "—we want to see how this ends—"

---

*[If few or no allies]*
The wings remain mostly empty. The Understudy stands with you, but their loneliness is palpable. The choices you've made echo in the silence—doors closed, hands not taken, trust not earned.

**The Understudy:** "I thought... I hoped more would come." They straighten, fighting to hide their disappointment. "But we don't need them. We have each other."

---

You survey those who have gathered. Each face is a story you've touched. Each ally is a choice that brought you here with more than just yourself.

If allies are present, you can coordinate your approach. If not, reconnaissance may be your only advantage.

---

**Choices:**

1. *[If allies present]* Hold a strategy session—coordinate your approach with those who've come → Node 304
2. *[If no allies present]* Survey the stage alone—reconnaissance is your advantage → Node 301
