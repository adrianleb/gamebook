## Node 342: The Revision Begins

*The Mainstage — Center Stage*

Your fingers close around the pen.

The world *shifts*.

Not physically—the Mainstage remains the same, the proscenium still rising impossibly high, the audience still watching from their infinite rows. But something fundamental changes in how you perceive it all. The narratives that once felt like walls now feel like... drafts. Suggestions. Things that could be otherwise.

The Final Draft's pages ruffle toward you, eager, expectant. Words form and dissolve at the edges of your vision. Stories whisper for attention. Endings cry out for revision.

It's overwhelming. Terrifying. Intoxicating.

**The Editor:** "Slowly." Their voice is distant now, fading. "One story at a time. That was my mistake—I tried to revise everything at once. One story at a time. One choice at a time."

The pen feels warm in your hand. Alive, almost.

And then you see them.

Figures at the edge of the stage, drawn by the shift in power. Characters from stories you've touched during your journey through the Understage. Each one carrying an ending they never chose.

[If `RUNAWAY_ALLIED`:]
The Runaway steps forward first. Their eyes are wet. "You can change it," they whisper. "My ending. The death I was written for. You can—" They stop themselves. "Can you?"

[If `REVENANT_LIMBO`:]
The Revenant drifts closer, their form flickering. "End me," they plead. "Please. I've been waiting so long for someone who could write 'The End' and make it *stay*."

[If `PAWN_ALLIED`:]
The Prophecy's Pawn watches you with knowing eyes. "So you're the author now," they say. "I wonder if you'll be any different. I hope you will."

One story. One choice. Your first act as the new Editor.

You turn to the one who needs it most. Perhaps the Runaway, trapped between their old ending and an uncertain future. Perhaps someone else—a fragment from the Archives, a minor character who deserved more than they were given.

The pen touches paper.

You write.

Not a death. Not an escape. Something new—an ending that allows for what comes after. An ending that the character themselves might have chosen, if anyone had asked.

The Understage *stabilizes*. The shaking that has been building since your confrontation with the Editor quiets. The narrative threads that were fraying begin to knit themselves back together.

Not into what they were. Into something that could endure.

Your first revision. It cost you something—a thread of certainty, a piece of your own story absorbed into the change you made. You feel lighter and heavier at once.

This is what it means to hold the pen. This is the price.
