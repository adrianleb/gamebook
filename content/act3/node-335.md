## Node 335: The Last Curtain Call

*The Mainstage — Center Stage*

The confrontation has reached its end. Not its resolution—that remains to be determined—but the point where all paths converge.

The Final Draft lies before you, no longer the Editor's alone. Its pages flutter in an unfelt wind, awaiting the hand that will complete them. The Editor stands nearby—defeated, or cooperative, or locked in stalemate, depending on how you reached this moment.

And the Mainstage itself seems to hold its breath.

**The Editor:** "So." Their voice is quiet now, stripped of the commanding power it once held. "We're here. At the ending. Or rather—at the choice of endings."

They gesture at the Final Draft.

**The Editor:** "The manuscript is incomplete. It always was—I could never quite write the final page. And now that you've... intervened... I find I can't write it alone."

The pages turn, revealing blank space where the conclusion should be. White emptiness waiting for ink. The story of the Understage, suspended at its climactic moment.

**The Editor:** "The pen is shared now. Whatever ending we write—or refuse to write—we write together."

*The Final Draft reviews your journey:*

**Faction Alignment:**
The pages flutter through accumulated moments—every choice that tilted you toward Preservationist, Revisionist, Exiter, or Independent thinking. Your dominant alignment glows faintly.

**Key Relationships:**
Allies you've made (and lost) appear as marginalia—brief notes in the manuscript's borders. Those who sacrificed, those who helped, those who abandoned you.

**Critical Choices:**
The turning points of your journey manifest as chapter headings: decisions that closed some paths and opened others.

**The Editor's State:**
Your relationship with the Editor—defeated, moved, collaborative, or stalemated—determines how they participate in what comes next.

*Now comes the final choice. The Understage awaits its ending.*

The options before you are:

---

**1. The Revised Draft** (Revisionist Ending)
*[Available if: Revisionist alignment dominant OR `COLLABORATION_OFFERED`]*

Take the pen. Claim the Editor's power—not to destroy the Understage, but to improve it. Stories will no longer be static things forced on characters; they'll be living narratives that can evolve, grow, respond to the needs of those within them.

You become the new Editor. The burden is heavy. The responsibility is eternal. But the power to revise, to improve, to give stories the endings they deserve—that power is also yours.

---

**2. The Open Book** (Exiter Ending)
*[Available if: Exiter alignment dominant OR `EDITOR_WAVERING` through emotional appeal]*

The boundary between fiction and reality dissolves—not through destruction, but through opening. Characters can walk into the real world. Real people can enter stories. The distinction between "fictional" and "real" becomes meaningless.

This is freedom in its most radical form. Chaos, yes—but free chaos. A world where stories are no longer cages but doorways.

**3. The Closed Canon** (Preservationist Ending)
*[Available if: Preservationist alignment dominant OR Editor defeated through combat]*

The Understage is sealed. Permanently, irrevocably, forever. No more breaches. No more Prompters. Stories become what they always were meant to be: complete, closed, perfect in their finitude.

Reality is protected. But imagination is diminished. The wonder fades along with the danger.

---

**4. The Blank Page** (Independent Ending)
*[Available if: Independent alignment OR `EDITOR_ALLY_POSSIBLE` from revelation sequence]*

The Editor revealed the truth: something worse than any faction conflict threatens the Understage. The Silence—anti-narrative, the end of meaning itself. Together, you and the Editor write an ending that ends both the threat and the Understage, leaving reality intact but the doorway gone.

It's the only way to stop what's coming. But it means losing everything you've fought to protect.

---

**5. The Eternal Rehearsal** (Refusal Ending)
*[Available if: No choice made, deadline passed, or player refuses other options]*

You don't choose. Can't choose. Won't choose. The Final Draft remains incomplete. The conflict remains unresolved. The Understage continues in its state of perpetual crisis.

This isn't failure—not exactly. It's the choice to remain in the liminal space forever. To be the eternal Prompter of an eternal rehearsal, never reaching opening night.

→ Go to Node 354 (No Ending)

The pages of the Final Draft wait. The Editor watches. The Mainstage, the Understage, every story ever told and every character who ever lived in those stories—they all wait for your decision.
