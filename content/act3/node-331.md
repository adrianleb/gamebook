## Node 331: Collaborative Revision

*The Mainstage — Center Stage*

You stand beside the Editor at the Final Draft. Not as adversaries, but as co-authors.

The manuscript spreads before you like a living map—pages flowing in patterns that respond to both of your presences now. Where before it pulsed with the Editor's singular will, it now wavers between you, awaiting joint direction.

**The Editor:** "I've never... worked with anyone. On the Draft." Their hands hover uncertainly over the pages. "I'm not sure how to begin."

**You:** "Start by showing me what you've written. Let me see the transformation you're proposing."

The Editor nods, and pages shift to reveal their vision: a redesigned Understage where stories can evolve without breaking, where characters gain agency within their narratives, where the boundary between fiction and reality becomes more permeable but not shattered.

It's beautiful. It's also incomplete.

You point to the gaps—places where the Editor's solitary perspective has created blind spots. The transformation assumes all characters want agency, but some find comfort in their roles. It treats stories as entities to be improved, but doesn't account for stories that are perfect precisely because they're finite.

**The Editor:** "I... didn't see those." Their voice is strange—humbled, perhaps. "I was so focused on freedom that I forgot not everyone experiences constraints as cages."

**You:** "That's why collaboration matters. You see what needs to change. I see what needs to stay the same. Together, we might write something that works for everyone."

The question now is whether you can actually work together—whether your combined skills can create something neither of you could achieve alone.

**[COMBINED CHECK: Script 2 + Stage Presence 2 + Improv 2]**

*This check requires competence in all three areas—understanding narrative (Script), projecting your vision (Stage Presence), and adapting to unexpected developments (Improv). You must meet or exceed the threshold in each stat.*

---

**Success (All Three Checks Passed):**

The collaboration flows.

Your Script knowledge helps you and the Editor identify narrative structures that can flex without breaking. Your Stage Presence ensures the transformation feels earned, not imposed—characters will accept changes they can sense as authentic. Your Improv allows you both to adapt when the Draft resists, finding creative solutions to problems neither of you anticipated.

Hours pass—or perhaps moments. Time moves strangely during creation.

When you finally step back, the Final Draft has changed. It's no longer the Editor's singular vision, nor is it your opposition to that vision. It's something new: a blueprint for an Understage where transformation is offered rather than enforced. Where characters can choose to evolve or choose to remain. Where stories end, but not by decree.

**The Editor:** "We did it." They stare at the revised Draft with something like wonder. "It's not what I imagined, but it's... better. It accounts for things I never considered. It's *alive* in a way my version never was."

They turn to you, and for the first time, there's warmth in their expression.

**The Editor:** "I've been alone so long I forgot what partnership felt like. Thank you for reminding me."

The collaborative revision is complete. You've proven that even fundamental conflicts can be resolved through joint creation rather than opposition.

**Failure (One or More Checks Failed):**

The collaboration starts well, but fractures begin to appear.

If you lack sufficient Script knowledge, you misread the narrative structures, and your suggested changes conflict with each other. If your Stage Presence falters, the Draft doesn't believe in your contributions—the pages resist your touch. If your Improv is insufficient, you can't adapt when problems arise, and early setbacks cascade into irrecoverable conflicts.

**The Editor:** "It's not working." Their voice tightens with frustration. "You're pulling in one direction, I'm pulling in another—the Draft is tearing."

The pages scatter, your joint vision collapsing.

**You:** "Wait—if we just adjust—"

**The Editor:** "There's no time for adjustment! The Draft requires coherence. Without it, the transformation becomes destruction."

They step back, their expression closing off.

**The Editor:** "I was wrong to think this could work. Perhaps I was always meant to do this alone." Their hands close into fists. "We're back where we started, Prompter. Your collaboration has failed. Now we must resolve this the old way."

The alliance has collapsed. The Editor is reasserting control.
