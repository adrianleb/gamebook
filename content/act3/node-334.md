## Node 334: The Sacrifice

*The Mainstage — Center Stage*

Some choices cost more than others. This is one of them.

You've reached the point where victory—or at least survival—requires someone to pay a price that can't be reclaimed. Not a tactical sacrifice, not a clever gambit, but a genuine loss. Something precious, given up for something necessary.

The Editor's control wavers in the moment of sacrifice, disrupted by an act of narrative weight too significant to ignore. Stories *notice* when something real is offered up.

*[The nature of the sacrifice depends on who makes it]*

**If Maren sacrifices herself (`MAREN_TRUST_HIGH` and player choice):**

Maren steps forward, and you see forty years of exhaustion in her posture—and forty years of purpose.

**Maren:** "I've been a Prompter since before you were born. I've held the boundary, kept the peace, managed crises that would have broken anyone else. And I've been so tired, Prompter. So very tired."

She looks at the Editor with something like tenderness.

**Maren:** "We were partners once. Did you know that? Before you chose your path and I chose mine. Before we both made mistakes we couldn't unmake." She shakes her head. "I could never fix what broke between us. But I can give you one last thing: a disruption you can't edit around."

The Editor's expression cracks.

**The Editor:** "Maren—don't—you don't have to—"

**Maren:** "I don't have to. I choose to. That's what makes it a sacrifice."

She turns to you.

**Maren:** "When I'm gone, the energy I've accumulated—forty years of walking between stories—will release. It'll break the Editor's hold on the Mainstage completely. For a few moments, you'll have full control. Use it wisely."

She smiles, and it's the warmest expression you've ever seen on her face.

**Maren:** "You'll make a good Prompter. A better one than me. I knew it the moment I saw you."

Then she closes her eyes and *lets go*.

The release is silent and overwhelming. Maren's form dissolves into light—into the accumulated stories she's touched, the boundaries she's maintained, the characters she's guided. The energy floods outward, and the Editor's narrative control shatters.

The Editor screams—not in pain, but in loss. Something they'd forgotten they cared about has been ripped away.

The Mainstage is yours. For a few precious moments, you hold the power to write the ending.

**If you sacrifice yourself (player choice, regardless of Maren's presence):**

There's no one else who can do this. No mentor to step in, no ally to take your place. The price must be paid, and you're the only one who can pay it.

**You:** "If it can't be anyone else, then it has to be me."

The Editor watches as you begin to work—not fighting them, but fighting *yourself*. Reaching into your own narrative. Finding the threads that make you who you are.

**The Editor:** "What are you doing?"

**You:** "I'm writing myself out. Not all of me—just enough. The parts that give me weight in this narrative. The accumulated story of being a Prompter."

You find the threads: the first time you walked between stories. The characters you've helped. The crises you've averted. The person you became through experience.

One by one, you begin to cut them.

**The Editor:** "You'll be diminished. You'll lose—"

**You:** "I know what I'll lose. But I'll still be here. Changed. Lesser. But present."

Each cut hurts. Each thread releasing feels like losing a memory, a skill, a piece of identity. You feel yourself becoming simpler, younger in experience if not in years, raw and unformed.

But you also feel the narrative weight releasing. The power flooding outward. The Editor's control cracking under the force of genuine sacrifice.

When it's done, you're... different. The Prompter you were is gone. The Prompter you might become stands in their place, uncertain but alive.

And the Mainstage is yours.

**What the Sacrifice Accomplished:**

The Editor's hold on the Mainstage has been broken completely. Their power hasn't vanished—the Final Draft still exists, still pulses with potential—but they're no longer in sole control.

The confrontation has reached its final turning point. Whatever happens next, it happens on equal terms.

What was sacrificed can't be restored. But what was gained might be worth the cost.

That's the nature of sacrifice: you never know if it was worth it until after it's too late to take it back.

- `MAREN_SACRIFICED` (if Maren made the sacrifice) — Maren has given her life; affects ending tone and epilogue
- `SELF_SACRIFICED` (if you made the sacrifice) — You have diminished yourself; affects character and ending options

**Flags Checked:** `MAREN_TRUST_HIGH` (determines whether Maren sacrifice option is available)
