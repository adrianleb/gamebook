## Node 346: The Doors Open

*The Mainstage — The Threshold*

You don't destroy the Final Draft. You *transform* it.

Your hands move across its pages, not erasing what's written but rewriting the rules that govern it. Where the manuscript once said "the boundary between fiction and reality shall be maintained," you write something new:

*The door shall open both ways.*

The Understage *shudders*.

For a moment, nothing happens. Then—

The proscenium arch cracks. Not breaking, but *changing*. Light bleeds through—not stage light, but sunlight. Actual, honest, reality's-own sunlight streaming through fissures in the fabric of the fictional world.

And through those cracks, you see them coming.

Characters. Thousands of them. Millions. Every story ever told, every figure ever imagined, every person who lived only in the space between pages—they're *walking*. Toward the light. Toward reality. Toward freedom.

**The Editor:** "What have you done?" But there's no accusation in their voice. Only wonder. Only terror. Only awe.

[If `QUEST_ALLY`:]
The Unfinished Quest is the first of your allies to cross. They step through the crack in the proscenium, and on the other side, you see them stumble. Their legs work differently in reality—no narrative guiding their movements, no author choreographing their steps. They fall.

And then they laugh.

They *laugh*, sprawled on real ground, breathing real air, free for the first time in their existence.

"It's *heavy*," they call back. "Reality is so *heavy*. Every choice matters. Nothing is written." They push themselves up. "It's beautiful."

[If `RUNAWAY_ALLIED`:]
The Runaway passes you, tears streaming down their face. "Thank you," they whisper. "I don't have to run anymore. I can just... live."

[If `HAPPY_ENDING_FRIEND`:]
The Happy Ending hesitates at the threshold. "If I go through," they say quietly, "there's no guarantee I get a happy ending. No author to write it for me. I'll have to *earn* it." They take a breath. "That's terrifying." A pause. "That's wonderful." And they step through.

But the crossing isn't one-way.

From the other side—from reality—you see *people* approaching the cracks. Real humans, drawn by something they can't name. A child reaches through and touches the Understage floor, gasps in wonder as narrative possibility flows around their fingers. An old man steps halfway in, looking at the stories unfolding around him with tears in his eyes.

*"I can see it,"* he whispers. *"All of it. Every story I ever loved. They're real. They were always real."*

The boundary isn't falling. It's transforming. Becoming permeable. Becoming a choice rather than a wall.

New rules are forming even as the old ones break. Not every character will cross. Not every person will enter. But the option exists now—the *freedom* exists.

The Mainstage is no longer just a stage.

It's a door.
