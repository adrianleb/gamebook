## Node 313: Discordant Reveal

*The Orchestra Pit — Aftermath*

The silence is worse than the cacophony.

Every instrument in the pit has turned away from you, their attention—their potential—withdrawn. You still hold the baton, but it's gone cold and inert. A tool that no longer recognizes you as its wielder.

From above, the Editor's voice continues, conversational and cutting:

**The Editor:** "The pit was here before me, you know. Before any Editor. It's older than the stories we tell—it's the *why* of storytelling. The need to feel. To make others feel." A pause. "You understood enough to find it. Not enough to use it."

The stairs back up suddenly seem impossibly long. The Mainstage waits above, and so does the Editor—now fully aware of your approach, your methods, your weakness. They've written you into their score. Not as a countermelody but as a *disruption*—something to be resolved, corrected, edited out.

You begin the climb.

Halfway up, the Editor speaks again, their voice somehow closer:

**The Editor:** "You have a choice, little Prompter. Crawl back up and face what's coming. Or stay in the pit until your story ends quietly. I won't wait long for the decision."

**[STAT CHECK: Stage Presence 2]**

**Success:** You climb faster.

The Editor wants you demoralized. They want you to carry the weight of failure onto the stage, to appear diminished and defeated. But Stage Presence isn't just performance—it's *presence*. The ability to own a space regardless of circumstance.

You emerge from the pit with your head high. Yes, you failed. Yes, the Editor knows you're coming. But you're still *you*—not a disruption to be corrected, but a character with their own arc, their own agency.

The Editor watches you approach. Something flickers across their face—not concern, not yet, but perhaps *interest*. You've been warned, but you haven't been broken.

**Failure:** Each step takes effort. The Editor's words echo in your skull: *amateurs*, *useful*, *don't understand*. By the time you reach the top, your shoulders have dropped, your eyes scan the ground. You feel like a stagehand accidentally caught in the spotlight—exposed, unprepared, wrong.

The Mainstage stretches before you. At Center Stage, the Editor rises from their desk, pen still in hand, and turns to face you fully. They don't smile. They don't need to.

**The Editor:** "There you are."

They've been waiting. They've always been waiting. And now you face them on their terms, your presence diminished, their opening already scripted.

**Flags Set:** `EDITOR_WARNED`

**Note:** The EDITOR_WARNED flag affects the Editor's dialogue and tactical position in the confrontation. They will reference the pit manipulation and adjust their approach accordingly. Recovery via the Stage Presence check mitigates but does not remove this flag—you are warned, but not broken.
