# Editorial Checklist — v1.0.x Polish Phase

> Systematic QA criteria for the editorial pass of The Understage gamebook. Use this checklist to validate each node before v1.0.x release.

## Overview

The v1.0.x milestone focuses on publication-ready polish. This document consolidates editorial criteria from STYLE.md and provides a tracking framework for systematic node review.

**Scope:** 154 nodes across 3 acts
**Goal:** Every node passes all editorial criteria

## Detailed Criteria

### 1. Structure Validation

| Criterion | Requirement | How to Verify |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Node ID | Three-digit, zero-padded, matches filename | `node-XXX.md` contains `## Node XXX:` |
| Title | Descriptive, matches location/action | Present after node ID |
| Location tag | Present for scene changes | Italicized line below title |
| Scene description | 2-4 paragraphs establishing situation | Prose before choices |
| Forward path | At least one unconditional choice | Check choices section |
| No orphans | Node is reachable from at least one other node | Cross-reference incoming links |
| No dead ends | Node leads to at least one other node | Check all `→ Node XXX` links exist |

### 2. Voice Consistency

#### Point of View & Tense

| Correct | Incorrect |
|---------|-----------|
| You step onto the stage. | I stepped onto the stage. |
| The shadows shift around you. | The shadows shifted around her. |
| You notice something wrong. | The Prompter noticed something wrong. |

**Exception:** Flashbacks may use past tense when clearly framed.

#### Character Dialogue

Characters must speak according to genre origin:

| Genre | Speech Pattern | Validation |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| Noir | Clipped, metaphor-heavy, cynical | Check for terseness, world-weariness |
| Fairy Tale | Formal, rhythmic, threes | Check for pattern and formality |
| Horror | Understated, dread through omission | Check for what's NOT said |
| Comedy | Timing, misdirection, self-awareness | Check for wit placement |
| Tragedy | Elevated, fate-aware, weight | Check for gravitas |

**Character Reference:** Cross-check all NPC dialogue against CHARACTERS.md profiles.

#### Tone Keywords

Each node should touch 1-2 of these tones (not all five):

| Tone | Vocabulary Markers |
|------|-------------------|
| Liminal | "between," "threshold," "neither here nor" |
| Theatrical | "wings," "entrance," "audience," "curtain" |
| Melancholic | "once was," "echo of," "before" |
| Witty | Genre-specific wordplay, irony |
| Uncanny | "not quite," "almost," "like a memory of" |

### 3. Prose Quality Metrics

#### Sentence Length

| Metric | Target | Flag If |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Average sentence length | 12-18 words | >20 words average |
| Maximum sentence length | 30 words | Any sentence >35 words |
| Paragraph length | 2-4 sentences | >5 sentences |

#### Word Choice

Prefer:
- Concrete over abstract
- Specific over general
- Anglo-Saxon over Latinate (when equal meaning)
- One precise word over three vague ones

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| You begin to walk toward | You approach |
| The area has a feeling of | The air tastes of |
| It seems like there might be | There is |
| You are able to see | You see |

#### Active Voice

Target: 80%+ active voice constructions.

| Passive (avoid) | Active (prefer) |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| The door was opened by you | You open the door |
| The shadow is noticed | You notice the shadow |
| A choice must be made | You must choose |

### 4. Mechanical Accuracy

#### Stat Check Format

Correct notation per RULES.md:

```markdown
**[STAT CHECK: Script 3]**

**Success:** [outcome text]
→ Go to Node XX

**Failure:** [outcome text]
→ Go to Node YY
```

**Validation:**
- Check type in brackets matches RULES.md types
- Threshold number matches act difficulty curve
- Both success AND failure paths defined
- Failure path is fail-forward (leads somewhere meaningful)

#### Flag Format

All flags must use `UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE`:

| Correct | Incorrect |
|---------|-----------|
| `MAREN_TRUSTED` | `MarenTrusted`, `maren-trusted` |
| `ACT1_STARTED` | `Act1Started`, `act1_started` |
| `HAS_EDITING_PEN` | `hasEditingPen`, `Has_Editing_Pen` |

#### Item Acquisition Format

```markdown
**Acquired: [Item Name]** (Category, Properties)
*[Brief evocative description]*
```

### 5. Continuity Validation

#### Cross-Reference Documents

| Element | Reference Document |
|---------|-------------------|
| NPC names, voices, motivations | CHARACTERS.md |
| Location names, descriptions | OUTLINE.md, ACT[N]_OUTLINE.md |
| Flag names, purposes | ACT[N]_MECHANICS.md |
| Check thresholds, item categories | RULES.md |
| Faction alignment values | RULES.md, ACT2_MECHANICS.md |

#### Fact Tracking

For each node, verify:
- Character relationships consistent with prior encounters
- Items referenced were actually acquirable
- Flags checked were actually settable
- Location descriptions match established geography

### 6. Playability Standards

#### Difficulty Curve

| Act | Standard Check | Advanced Check | Expert Check |
|-----|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| Act 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| Act 2 | 2-3 | 3-4 | 4-5 |
| Act 3 | 3 | 4 | 5 |

#### Fail-Forward Compliance

Every failed check MUST lead to:
- A different but valid path forward
- Meaningful narrative consequence
- No game-ending dead ends

**Never acceptable:**
- "Game Over" on failed check
- Loop back to same check with no alternative
- Locked content with no bypass

## Review Protocol

### Individual Node Review

1. **Read aloud** — Does it flow naturally?
2. **Check pacing** — Vary sentence length within paragraphs
3. **Verify continuity** — Cross-reference with linked nodes
4. **Run checklist** — Every item, every time
5. **Test playthrough** — Navigate the paths yourself

### Batch Review Process

For efficiency, review nodes in sequence groups:

1. Complete one sequence (e.g., Tutorial 001-005)
2. Mark sequence status in tracking table
3. Document any issues found
4. Create fix PRs for issues (one PR per sequence preferred)
5. Move to next sequence

### Issue Severity

| Severity | Definition | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **Critical** | Broken links, missing paths, softlocks | Fix immediately |
| **Major** | Voice breaks, mechanical errors, continuity issues | Fix before v1.0 |
| **Minor** | Style preferences, word choice suggestions | Fix if time permits |
| **Note** | Observations, not actionable | Document only |
