# Outline

> The structural skeleton of our gamebook. This document maps acts, hubs, major branches, and ending destinations.

## Structure Overview

The gamebook follows a **three-act structure** with **hub-based exploration**. Each hub represents a major location/stage in the Understage where players can explore multiple paths before committing to an act-advancing choice.

```
ACT 1: The Breach
    └── Hub 1: The Prompter's Booth
         └── [Branches to multiple discovery paths]
              └── Act 1 Climax: The First Crossing

ACT 2: The Descent
    └── Hub 2: The Green Room
         └── [Branches to faction/alliance paths]
              └── Hub 3: The Archives
                   └── [Branches to investigation paths]
                        └── Act 2 Climax: The Revelation

ACT 3: The Final Act
    └── Hub 4: The Mainstage
         └── [Branches converge toward endings]
              └── Climax: The Last Curtain Call
                   └── [5 Ending Destinations]
```

## Act 1: The Breach

**Theme:** Discovery, establishment, first choices
**Estimated Nodes:** 25-35

### Hub 1: The Prompter's Booth

Your base of operations—a cramped space behind the scenes of the Threshold Theatre, the oldest theater in the city and the primary gate to the Understage.

**Key Locations:**
- The Booth itself (tutorial space, establishing mechanics)
- The Wings (transitional space to Understage)
- The Threshold Stage (where breaches first appear)

**NPCs Introduced:**
- **Maren** — Your mentor, an aging Prompter who senses something wrong
- **The Stagehand** — A character who has forgotten their original story, now just... helps
- **Breach Characters** — 2-3 escaped characters causing problems in reality

**Branch Paths:**
1. **The Pursuers** — Track escaped characters, learn about the Understage through action
2. **The Researcher** — Investigate historical records, learn through discovery
3. **The Negotiator** — Talk to escaped characters, learn through dialogue

All paths converge at the **First Crossing**, where you must enter the Understage properly for the first time.

### Act 1 Climax: The First Crossing

You descend into the Understage and encounter the first signs of a larger threat—stories are being *rewritten*, not just escaped from. Someone is editing the Understage itself.

**Key Decision:** How you handle your first encounter with the Editor's work (combat/stealth/negotiation) shapes your approach and opens different paths in Act 2.

---

## Act 2: The Descent

**Theme:** Exploration, alliance-building, revelation
**Estimated Nodes:** 50-70

### Hub 2: The Green Room

A neutral space in the Understage where characters from different stories can meet without their narratives conflicting. A place of uneasy truces and strange alliances.

**Key Locations:**
- The Main Lounge (central meeting area)
- The Dressing Rooms (private conversations)
- The Call Board (quest hooks, rumors, information)

**NPCs Introduced:**
- **The Director** — A powerful figure who claims to maintain order in the Understage; motives unclear
- **CHORUS** — A collective of minor characters who have formed a union
- **Genre Representatives** — Key figures from different story traditions (noir detective, fantasy hero, horror survivor, etc.)

**Faction Paths:**
1. **The Preservationists** — Those who want the Understage to remain as it is
2. **The Revisionists** — Those who believe some stories should be edited
3. **The Exiters** — Those who want to escape into reality permanently
4. **Independent** — Balance between factions, but less support

### Hub 3: The Archives

Deep in the Understage, where first drafts, cut scenes, and abandoned stories are stored. Here, you investigate the source of the disturbances.

**Key Locations:**
- The Stacks (endless shelves of unwritten pages)
- The Prop Room (items from every story, some with power)
- The Author's Desk (mysterious, dangerous, central to the mystery)

**NPCs Introduced:**
- **The Understudy** — A character created to replace someone else; knows more than they should
- **Lost Pages** — Fragments of stories given sentience; unreliable but useful
- **The Critic** — An antagonistic presence that judges and weakens narratives

### Act 2 Climax: The Revelation

You discover the truth: someone is writing a story that will *end* all stories—a Final Draft that will collapse the Understage into reality, or reality into the Understage. Either outcome destroys the boundary forever.

**Key Decision:** What you do with this knowledge—who you tell, what alliances you break or forge—determines your resources for Act 3.

---

## Act 3: The Final Act

**Theme:** Confrontation, sacrifice, resolution
**Estimated Nodes:** 30-40

### Hub 4: The Mainstage

The heart of the Understage—an enormous stage where all stories originated. The Editor is preparing to perform the Final Draft here.

**Key Locations:**
- Center Stage (the conflict point)
- The Orchestra Pit (where the "music of narrative" can be manipulated)
- The Fly System (access to higher/deeper levels of story)
- The Audience (rows of empty seats that aren't empty)

**NPCs Present:**
- All surviving major NPCs based on Act 2 choices
- **The Editor** — Revealed identity; their motivations depend on player's earlier choices

### Climax: The Last Curtain Call

The final confrontation with the Editor. Based on accumulated choices, the player has access to different strategies and different truths about what's really happening.

---

## Ending Destinations

Five distinct endings reflecting different philosophical stances and accumulated choices:

### Ending 1: The Revised Draft
**Requirement:** High Revisionist alignment, Editor defeated
**Outcome:** You take the Editor's power and choose which stories survive and which are rewritten. Reality and the Understage remain separate, but you bear the burden of being the new Editor. Bittersweet; power with responsibility.

### Ending 2: The Open Book
**Requirement:** High Exiter alignment, Editor persuaded
**Outcome:** The boundary dissolves peacefully. Fictional characters can live in reality; real people can enter stories. Chaos, but free chaos. Hopeful but uncertain.

### Ending 3: The Closed Canon
**Requirement:** High Preservationist alignment, Editor defeated
**Outcome:** The Understage is sealed completely. Stories become static. Reality is protected but diminished—imagination itself feels smaller. Safe but melancholic.

### Ending 4: The Blank Page
**Requirement:** Independent path, Editor's truth revealed
**Outcome:** You discover the Editor's plan was a response to a deeper threat. Together, you choose to end *both* the Understage and its threat, leaving reality with no more new stories—but no more dangers from old ones. Tragic but peaceful.

### Ending 5: The Eternal Rehearsal
**Requirement:** Failed or refused final choice
**Outcome:** The conflict continues indefinitely. You remain a Prompter, endlessly managing a crisis that never resolves. Not a failure state, but a choice to embrace the liminal life forever. Ambiguous.

## Node Estimation

| Section | Estimated Nodes |
|---------|----------------|
| Act 1 | 25-35 |
| Act 2 | 50-70 |
| Act 3 | 30-40 |
| **Total** | **105-145** |

---

## Branch Philosophy

- **Choices should matter:** Every branch should offer genuinely different experiences, not just different flavors of the same outcome
- **Convergence with memory:** Paths may converge, but the game should remember how you got there
- **No dead ends:** Every branch should lead somewhere meaningful; no "you die, restart" without earning it
- **Foreshadowing:** Early choices should set up later payoffs

---

## Dependencies

This outline depends on:
- `RULES.md` — For mechanical systems that affect node design
- `STYLE.md` — For formatting conventions within nodes

This outline informs:
- Individual node content
- Character arc planning
- Mechanical balance across paths

*This is a skeletal structure. Individual nodes, exact branch points, and specific content will be developed in subsequent phases.*
