## Overview

**Project**: The Understage
**Type**: Interactive Fiction / Gamebook
**Domain**: Meta-narrative choice-based storytelling

## Description

A gamebook where the reader plays as a "Prompter" — someone who can traverse the shadow dimension beneath all theaters where abandoned stories persist. Navigate shifting stages, interact with escaped characters, and decide the fate of stories themselves.

## Project Structure

### Story Architecture
- **3 Acts**: The Breach → The Descent → The Final Act
- **4 Hubs**: Entrance theater, Crossroads, Backstage Maze, The Stage Eternal
- **5 Endings**: Different philosophical resolutions
- **105-145 Nodes**: Total estimated content nodes

### Core Mechanics
- **Stats**: Script, Stage Presence, Improv (6 starting points, max 9)
- **Checks**: Deterministic threshold system (no dice)
- **Inventory**: 5-item limit, categorized items
- **Flags**: Story, Relationship, Faction, Choice tracking
- **Factions**: Preservationists, Revisionists, Exiters

### Design Principles
1. Fail-forward bias (no dead ends)
2. Choices matter (meaningful consequences)
3. Minimal viable complexity
4. Thematic resonance
