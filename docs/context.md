## Overview

**Project**: The Understage
**Type**: Interactive Fiction / Gamebook
**Domain**: Meta-narrative choice-based storytelling

## Description

A gamebook where the reader plays as a "Prompter" — someone who can traverse the shadow dimension beneath all theaters where abandoned stories persist. Navigate shifting stages, interact with escaped characters, and decide the fate of stories themselves.
