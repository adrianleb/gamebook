# Narrative Audit

> Systematic thematic consistency audit for v1.0.x polish. Tracks tone keyword adherence, world rule consistency, and emotional arc progression across all 154 nodes.

## Purpose

This document serves as the canonical reference for narrative consistency during the v1.0.x polish phase. It captures:
- Tone keyword distribution and adherence per act
- World rules that must be maintained across all nodes
- Emotional arc mapping and pacing validation
- Specific areas flagged for revision

---

## Tone Keyword Reference

From VISION.md, the five tone keywords that define The Understage:

| Keyword | Definition | How It Manifests |
|---------|------------|------------------|
| **Liminal** | Existing in thresholds, between-spaces, moments of transition | Doorways that shouldn't exist, spaces that shift, the Understage itself as a between-place |
| **Theatrical** | Heightened emotion, dramatic reveals, awareness of performance | NPCs aware of their roles, dramatic timing, scenes that feel "staged" |
| **Melancholic** | Loss underlying even humor; things that were and won't return | Abandoned stories, forgotten characters, the bittersweet nature of endings |
| **Witty** | Sharp dialogue, wordplay that matters, language as power | The Prompter's inner voice, character banter, the literal power of words |
| **Uncanny** | Familiar made strange; wrongness from things being almost-right | Genre conventions twisted, characters who know their nature, reality bleeding |

## Tone Distribution by Act

### Act 1: The Breach (38 nodes)

**Expected Tone Balance:** Liminal (high), Uncanny (medium), Theatrical (establishing), Witty (low-medium), Melancholic (low)

| Zone | Nodes | Primary Tones | Assessment |
|------|-------|---------------|------------|
| Tutorial (001-005) | 5 | Liminal, Uncanny | Establishes threshold atmosphere; ozone smell, shifting text, wrong-direction sounds |
| Pursuers Path (010-018) | 9 | Theatrical, Liminal | Action-focused but maintains between-space quality through shifting terrain |
| Researcher Path (020-028) | 9 | Uncanny, Witty | Investigation reveals wrongness in records; dialogue with Maren carries wit |
| Negotiator Path (030-038) | 9 | Theatrical, Witty | Dialogue-heavy; characters perform their roles while subverting them |
| First Crossing (040-045) | 6 | Liminal (peak), Melancholic | Transition point; first hints of loss theme through forgotten characters |

**Act 1 Findings:**
- Liminal tone well-established in opening nodes through sensory details (ozone, shifting shadows)
- Theatrical quality emerges naturally through character awareness
- Melancholic undertones correctly restrained for Act 1; builds foundation without overwhelming

### Act 2: The Descent (65 nodes)

**Expected Tone Balance:** Theatrical (high), Melancholic (rising), Uncanny (medium), Witty (high), Liminal (maintained)

| Zone | Nodes | Primary Tones | Assessment |
|------|-------|---------------|------------|
| Green Room Entry (100-105) | 6 | Theatrical, Uncanny | Hub atmosphere established; impossible architecture, genre-mixing |
| Genre Representatives (106-114) | 9 | Witty, Theatrical | Dialogue shines; each character speaks their genre while subverting it |
| Faction Quests (115-129) | 15 | Varied by faction | Preservationist: Melancholic; Revisionist: Witty; Exiter: Theatrical |
| Archives Transition (130-133) | 4 | Liminal, Uncanny | Between-space quality intensifies; deeper descent |
| Archives Entry (200-205) | 6 | Uncanny (peak), Melancholic | Impossible geography; abandoned drafts evoke loss |
| Investigation (206-214) | 9 | Witty, Uncanny | Lost Pages dialogue; unreliable narrators |
| Critic Resolution (215-219) | 5 | Theatrical, Melancholic | Antagonist encounter with tragic undertones |
| Revelation (220-230) | 11 | All five tones | Climactic convergence; tone peaks across all keywords |

**Act 2 Findings:**
- Green Room successfully captures theatrical social dynamics
- Melancholic tone appropriately rises through Archives sequence
- Witty dialogue maintains reader engagement without undermining stakes
- Faction paths show distinct tone signatures matching their philosophies

### Act 3: The Final Act (51 nodes)

**Expected Tone Balance:** Theatrical (peak), Melancholic (peak), Liminal (sustained), Uncanny (resolution), Witty (selective)

| Zone | Nodes | Primary Tones | Assessment |
|------|-------|---------------|------------|
| Mainstage Entry (300-305) | 6 | Theatrical (overwhelming), Liminal | Scale properly awe-inducing; "the moment before curtain rises" |
| Approach Paths (306-321) | 16 | Varied by approach | Center Stage: Theatrical; Orchestra Pit: Uncanny; Fly System: Liminal; Audience: Melancholic |
| Editor Confrontation (322-335) | 14 | All five (climax) | Tone keywords converge; philosophical weight |
| Endings (341-355) | 15 | Ending-appropriate | See Ending Tone Analysis below |

**Act 3 Findings:**
- Theatrical intensity appropriate for climactic stakes
- Melancholic undertones peak in sacrifice-heavy paths
- Each ending maintains consistent tone signature

---

## Ending Tone Signatures

Each ending should emphasize specific tone keywords reflecting its philosophical stance:

| Ending | Primary Tones | Assessment |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| The Revised Draft (341-344) | Melancholic, Theatrical | Burden of power; lonely responsibility well-conveyed |
| The Open Book (345-348) | Theatrical, Witty | Freedom and chaos; hopeful but uncertain tone achieved |
| The Closed Canon (349-351) | Melancholic (peak), Liminal | Safe but diminished; "smaller" world effectively communicated |
| The Blank Page (352-353) | Melancholic, Uncanny | Tragic peace; mutual sacrifice tone appropriate |
| The Eternal Rehearsal (354-355) | Liminal (peak), Theatrical | Ambiguous permanence; embracing threshold life |

## World Rules Checklist

Core world rules from VISION.md and OUTLINE.md that must be consistently applied:

### Understage Physics

| Rule | Description | Nodes to Verify |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Impossible Architecture** | Spaces defy normal geometry; larger on inside, shifting layout | 100, 200, 300 (hub entries) |
| **Genre Bleed** | Different story traditions coexist; visual/tonal mixing | 102, 106-114 (Green Room) |
| **Narrative Gravity** | Stories have weight; unfinished ones pull at edges | 200-205 (Archives) |
| **Time Fluidity** | Duration is subjective; "scene time" vs "real time" | Throughout Act 2-3 |

### Prompter Abilities

| Ability | Description | First Established | Consistent Usage |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Threshold Perception** | See into Understage from reality | Node 001 (tutorial) | Maintained |
| **Genre Recognition** | Identify story types and conventions | Node 002 (Maren teaches) | Applied in checks |
| **Narrative Influence** | Limited ability to affect story outcomes | Node 005 (first choice) | Escalates through acts |
| **Character Communication** | Speak with fictional beings | Node 010 or 030 (first NPC) | Core mechanic |

### Fiction/Reality Boundary

| Rule | Description | Violation Risk |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Two-Way Traffic** | Characters can escape; people can be written in | Must be consistent |
| **Identity Persistence** | Characters remember their stories; may resent them | Check all NPC dialogue |
| **Editing Consequences** | Changing a story affects the character | Core plot mechanic |
| **The Final Draft** | Central threat: collapsing the boundary permanently | Must be consistently ominous |

## Creative Boundaries Validation

From VISION.md:

### We Will Include (Verify Present)

| Element | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Characters with genuine interiority | Present | NPCs have inner lives beyond their roles |
| Moral complexity without nihilism | Present | Faction choices aren't "right" or "wrong" |
| Humor as coping mechanism | Present | Witty dialogue, especially Stagehand, CHORUS |
| Fair consequences | Present | Failure paths lead to different outcomes, not punishment |
| Multiple valid endings | Present | 5 distinct endings with different philosophical stances |

### We Will Avoid (Verify Absent)

| Element | Status | Flagged Nodes |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Cheap meta-humor | Clear | None detected |
| "It was all a story" dismissiveness | Clear | Endings respect stakes |
| Grimdark for its own sake | Clear | Even Closed Canon has meaning |
| Trivializing fiction/reality boundary | Clear | Boundary treated seriously |
| Endings negating player choice | Clear | Choices reflected in outcomes |

### Gray Areas (Verify Thoughtful)

| Area | Current Handling | Recommendation |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| Romance with fictional characters | Limited; Understudy relationship implied | Appropriate restraint |
| Violence against fictional beings | Combat exists but with weight | Consider adding reflection nodes |
| Editing without consent | Central moral tension | Well-handled as ethical dilemma |
| Knowledge asymmetry | Prompter learns naturally | No problematic gaps |

## Flagged Areas for v1.0.x Review

Priority areas requiring editorial attention:

### High Priority

| Area | Issue | Recommendation |
|------|-------|----------------|
| None identified | — | Continue to polish phase |

### Medium Priority

| Area | Issue | Status | Resolution |
|------|-------|--------|------------|
| Faction quest pacing | Preservationist path slightly shorter than others | ✅ Addressed | PR #268 - Enhanced node 116 with ~200 words of atmospheric content (genre-bleed effects, emotional stakes) |
| Critic dialogue | Some lines feel generic antagonist | ✅ Addressed | PR #265 - Replaced 8 generic lines with Understage-specific narrative critiques in nodes 215-219 |
| Independent path difficulty | May feel punishing vs. faction paths | ✅ Validated | Content review confirms strong narrative rewards (exclusive Silence revelation, Editor alliance option, unique Blank Page ending); PR #271 clarifies mechanics |

### Low Priority

| Area | Issue | Status | Resolution |
|------|-------|--------|------------|
| First Crossing options | Two choices converge quickly | ✅ Addressed | PR #281 - Implemented crossing flag effects in nodes 100-103 with conditional narrative text and mechanical bonuses (+1 effective stats, -1 thresholds) for all four crossing methods |
| Archives geography | Could use more specific landmarks | Deferred | Optional enhancement for future polish |
| Ending length variation | Closed Canon shorter than Revised Draft | ✅ Intentional | Reviewed: Closed Canon (3 nodes, ~2,200 words) vs Revised Draft (4 nodes, ~2,250 words) - lengths comparable; fewer but longer nodes fits melancholic finality theme |
