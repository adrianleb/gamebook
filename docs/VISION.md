# Vision

> The creative foundation for our gamebook. This document captures the chosen theme, premise, tone, and creative boundaries.

## Theme Proposals

Before settling on a direction, three distinct theme options were considered:

---

### Theme A: The Curator's Archive

**Pitch:** You are a newly appointed curator at a museum that exists between worlds—a vast, impossible archive containing artifacts from histories that never happened, futures that were prevented, and presents that exist only in memory. When objects begin disappearing and the Archive starts collapsing into itself, you must navigate shifting galleries, negotiate with the sentient exhibits, and decide which versions of reality deserve to be preserved.

**Signature Moments:**
1. Opening a display case and stepping *into* a painting, finding yourself in a Renaissance that never ended
2. Negotiating with a collection of war medals that remember every soldier who wore them—and every death they caused
3. Choosing which wing of the Archive to seal forever, knowing that entire civilizations will be forgotten

---

### Theme B: The Last Lighthouse

**Pitch:** On a storm-battered coast where the sea has been rising for generations, you inherit your grandmother's lighthouse—the last one still functioning. But this lighthouse doesn't guide ships. It guides *something else* home. As the waters claim more of the land and desperate refugees arrive seeking shelter, you must balance your duty as keeper, your humanity toward the displaced, and the growing realization that what you're guiding ashore may not have humanity's best interests at heart.

**Signature Moments:**
1. The first night you light the beacon and see shapes moving beneath the waves, moving toward you
2. A refugee child who speaks a language that hasn't been spoken in centuries
3. Standing at the top of the lighthouse as waters flood the lower floors, the beacon demanding to be lit

---

### Theme C: The Understage

**Pitch:** Beneath every theater lies the Understage—a shadow dimension where discarded characters, forgotten plays, and abandoned storylines continue to exist. You are a "Prompter," one of the rare people who can move between the real world and the Understage. When the boundary begins to blur and fictional characters start appearing in reality (while real people vanish into unfinished scripts), you must navigate a world of living metaphors, dramatic irony made literal, and the dangerous politics of stories that refuse to end.

**Signature Moments:**
1. Meeting a villain who knows they're a villain and resents being written that way
2. Discovering that a missing person has been "cast" as a minor character in someone else's tragedy
3. Rewriting a scene in real-time to save a life, knowing each word has weight and consequence

## Chosen Direction

**Selected Theme: The Understage (Theme C)**

The Understage offers the richest possibility space for a gamebook:
- Meta-narrative elements that reward reader awareness
- Natural justification for branching paths (stories can be rewritten)
- Strong player agency (you are a "Prompter" who literally prompts action)
- Diverse settings within a unified framework (every genre exists in the Understage)
- Built-in stakes (blurring of fiction and reality)

---

## Premise

You are a Prompter—one of the rare individuals who can perceive and traverse the Understage, the shadow dimension beneath all theaters where abandoned stories persist. For years, you've worked quietly: rescuing lost props, negotiating with temperamental characters, and ensuring the boundary between fiction and reality holds firm.

But something has changed. Characters are escaping their scripts. Real people are being written into unfinished tragedies. And somewhere in the deepest levels of the Understage, a story is being told that threatens to make all of reality its final act.

You must navigate the shifting stages, forge alliances with fictional beings of every genre, and ultimately decide: is reality worth preserving if it means silencing every story that ever was?

## Tone Keywords

| Keyword | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Liminal** | Existing in thresholds, between-spaces, moments of transition |
| **Theatrical** | Heightened emotion, dramatic reveals, awareness of performance |
| **Melancholic** | A sense of loss underlying even moments of humor; things that were and won't return |
| **Witty** | Sharp dialogue, wordplay that matters, language as power |
| **Uncanny** | Familiar made strange; the wrongness that comes from things being almost-right |

---

## Creative Boundaries

### We Will Include
- Characters with genuine interiority (even if that interiority is "written")
- Moral complexity without nihilism
- Humor as coping mechanism and genuine joy
- Consequences that feel fair, even when harsh
- Multiple valid endings that reflect player values

### We Will Avoid
- Cheap meta-humor that breaks investment
- "It was all a story" dismissiveness
- Grimdark for its own sake
- Trivializing the reality/fiction boundary
- Endings that negate player choice

### Gray Areas (Approach with Care)
- Romance with fictional characters (handle the power dynamics thoughtfully)
- Violence against beings who may or may not be "real"
- The ethics of "editing" someone's story without consent
- Player-character knowledge asymmetry (what you know vs. what the Prompter knows)

---

## Voice Targets

**Narrative Voice:** Second person, present tense. The reader IS the Prompter.

**Dialogue Voice:** Characters speak in ways that reflect their genre origins—a noir detective speaks differently than a fairy tale princess—but all can surprise and subvert expectations.

**Internal Voice:** The Prompter's thoughts should feel grounded and human, providing an anchor against the theatrical unreality of the Understage.
